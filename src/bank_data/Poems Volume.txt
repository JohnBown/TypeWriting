Let Fate or Insufficiency provideMean ends for men who what they are would bePenned in their narrow day no change they seeSave one which strikes the blow to brutes and pride.
Our faith is ours and comes not on a tideAnd whether Earths great offspring, by decree,Must rot if they abjure rapacity,Not argument but effort shall decide.
They number many heads in that hard flockTrim swordsmen they push forth yet try thy steel.
Thou, fighting for poor humankind, wilt feelThe strength of Roland in thy wrist to hewA chasm sheer into the barrier rock,And bring the army of the faithful through.
LINES TO A FRIEND VISITING AMERICAINow farewell to you! you areOne of my dearest, whom I trustNow follow you the Western star,And cast the old world off as dust.
IIFrom many friends adieu! adieu!The quick heart of the word therein.
Much that we hope for hangs with youWe lose you, but we lose to win.
IIIThe beggarking, November, fretsHis tatters rich with Indian dyesGoes hugging we our seasons debtsPay calmly, of the Spring forewise.
IVWe send our worthiest can no less,If we would now be read aright, To that great people who may blessOr curse mankind they have the might.
VThe proudest seasons find their graves,And we, who would not be wooed, must court.
We have let the blunderers and the wavesDivide us, and the devil had sport.
VIThe blunderers and the waves no moreShall sever kindred sending forthTheir worthiest from shore to shoreFor welcome, bent to prove their worth.
VIIGo you and such as you afloat,Our lost kinsfellowship to revive.
The battle of the antidoteIs tough, though silent may you thrive!VIIII, when in this North wind I seeThe straining red woods blown awry,Feel shuddering like the winter tree,All vein and artery on cold sky.
IXThe leaf that clothed me is torn awayMy friend is as a flying seed.
Ay, true to bring replenished dayLight ebbs, but I am bare, and bleed.
XWhat husky habitations seemThese comfortable sayings! they fell,In some rich year become a dreamSo cries my heart, the infidel! .

XIOh! for the strenuous mind in quest,Arabian visions could not vieWith those broad wonders of the West,And would I bid you stay Not I!XIIThe strange experimental landWhere men continually dare takeNiagara leapsunshattered standTwixt fall and fallfor conscience sake,XIIIDrive onward like a floods increase Fresh rapids and abysms engage We livewe die scorn fireside peace,And, as a garment, put on rage,XIVRather than bear Gods reprimand,By rearing on a full fat soilConcrete of sin and sloththis land,You will observe it coil in coil.
XVThe land has been discoverd long,The people we have yet to knowThemselves they know not, save that strongFor good and evil still they grow.
XVINor know they us.
 Yea, well enoughIn that inveterate machineThrough which we speak the printed stuffDaily, with voice most hugeous, mienXVIITremendous as a lions showThe grand menagerie paintings hideHear the drum beat, the trombones blow!The poor old Lion lies inside! .

XVIIIIt is not England that they hear,But mighty Mammons pipers, trainedTo trumpet out his moods, and stirHis sluggish soul HER voice is chainedXIXAlmost her spirit seems moribund!O teach them, tis not she displaysThe panic of a purse rotund,Eternal dread of evil days, XXThat haunting spectre of successWhich shows a heart sunk low in the girthsNot England answers nobleness, Live for thyself thou art not earths.
XXINot she, when struggling manhood triesFor freedom, air, a hopefuller fate,Points out the planet, Compromise,And shakes a mild reproving pateXXIISays never I am well at ease,My sneers upon the weak I shedThe strong have my cajoleriesAnd those beneath my feet I tread.
XXIIINay, but tis said for her, great Lord!The miserys there! The shameless oneAdjures mankind to sheathe the sword,Herself not yielding what it wonXXIVHer sermon at cockcrow doth preach,On sweet Prosperityor greed.
Lo! as the beasts feed, each for each,Gods blessings let us take, and feed!XXVUngrateful creatures crave a part She tells them firmly she is fullLost sheared sheep hurt her tender heartWith bleating, stops her ears with woolXXVISeized sometimes by prodigious qualmsNightmares of bankruptcy and death, Showers down in lumps a load of alms,Then pants as one who has lost a breathXXVIIBelieves high heaven, whence favours flow,Too kind to ask a sacrificeFor what it specially doth bestow Gives SHE, tis generous, cheese to mice.
XXVIIIShe saw the young Dominion stripFor battle with a grievous wrong,And curled a noble Norman lip,And looked with half an eye sidelongXXIXAnd in stout Saxon wrote her sneers,Denounced the waste of blood and coin,Implored the combatants, with tears,Never to think they could rejoin.
XXXOh! was it England that, alas!Turned sharp the victor to cajoleBehold her features in the glassA monstrous semblance mocks her soul!XXXIA false majority, by stealth,Have got her fast, and sway the rodA headless tyrant built of wealth,The hypocrite, the bellyGod.
XXXIITo him the daily hymns they raiseHis tastes are sought his will is doneHe sniffs the putrid steam of praise,Place for true England here is none!XXXIIIBut can a distant race discernThe difference twixt her and himMy friend, that will you bid them learn.
He shames and binds her, head and limb.
XXXIVOld wood has blossoms of this sort.
Though sound at core, she is old wood.
If freemen hate her, one retortShe has but one!You are my blood.
XXXVA poet, half a prophet, roseIn recent days, and called for power.
I love him but his mountain prose His Alp and valley and wild flower XXXVIProclaimed our weakness, not its source.
What medicine for disease had heWhom summoned for a show of forceOur titular aristocracy!XXXVIIWhy, these are great at City feastsFrom City riches mainly riseTis well to hear them, when the beastsThat die for us they eulogize!XXXVIIIBut these, of all the liveried crewObeisant in Mammons walk,Most deferent ply the facial screw,The spinal bend, submissive talk.
XXXIXSmall fear that they will run to booksAt least the better form of seed!I, too, have hoped from their good looks,And fables of their Northman breed XLHave hoped that they the land would headIn acts magnanimous but, lo,When fainting heroes beg for breadThey frown where they are driven they go.
XLIGood health, my friend! and may your lotBe cheerful oer the Western rounds.
This butterwomans markettrotOf verse is passing marketbounds.
XLIIAdieu! the sun sets he is gone.
On banks of fog faint lines extendAdieu! bring back a braver dawnTo England, and to me my friend.
November th, .
TIME AND SENTIMENTI see a fair young couple in a wood,And as they go, one bends to take a flower,That so may be embalmed their happy hour,And in another day, a kindred mood,Haply together, or in solitude,Recovered what the teeth of Time devour,The joy, the bloom, and the illusive power,Wherewith by their young blood they are enduedTo move all enviable, framed in May,And of an aspect sisterly with TruthYet seek they with Times laughing things to wedWho will be prompted on some pallid dayTo lift the hueless flower and show that dead,Even such, and by this token, is their youth.
LUCIFER IN STARLIGHTOn a starred night Prince Lucifer uprose.
Tired of his dark dominion swung the fiendAbove the rolling ball in cloud part screened,Where sinners hugged their spectre of repose.
Poor prey to his hot fit of pride were those.
And now upon his western wing he leaned,Now his huge bulk oer Africs sands careened,Now the black planet shadowed Arctic snows.
Soaring through wider zones that pricked his scarsWith memory of the old revolt from Awe,He reached a middle height, and at the stars,Which are the brain of heaven, he looked, and sank.
Around the ancient track marched, rank on rank,The army of unalterable law.
THE STAR SIRIUSBright Sirius! that when Orion palesTo dotlings under moonlight still art keenWith cheerful fervour of a warriors mienWho holds in his great heart the battlescalesUnquenched of flame though swift the flood assails,Reducing many lustrous to the leanBe thou my star, and thou in me be seenTo show what source divine is, and prevails.
Long watches through, at one with godly night,I mark thee planting joy in constant fireAnd thy quick beams, whose jets of life inspireLife to the spirit, passion for the light,Dark Earth since first she lost her lord from sightHas viewed and felt them sweep her as a lyre.
SENSE AND SPIRITThe senses loving Earth or well or illRavel yet more the riddle of our lot.
The mind is in their trammels, and lights notBy trimming fearbred tales nor does the willTo find in nature things which less may chillAn ardour that desires, unknowing what.
Till we conceive her living we go distraught,At best but circlewindsails of a mill.
Seeing she lives, and of her joy of lifeCreatively has given us blood and breathFor endless war and never wound unhealed,The gloomy Wherefore of our battlefieldSolves in the Spirit, wrought of her through strifeTo read her own and trust her down to death.
EARTHS SECRETNot solitarily in fields we findEarths secret open, though one page is thereHer plainest, such as children spell, and shareWith bird and beast raised letters for the blind.
Not where the troubled passions toss the mind,In turbid cities, can the key be bare.
It hangs for those who hither thither fare,Close interthreading nature with our kind.
They, hearing History speak, of what men were,And have become, are wise.
 The gain is greatIn vision and solidity it lives.
Yet at a thought of life apart from her,Solidity and vision lose their state,For Earth, that gives the milk, the spirit gives.
INTERNAL HARMONYAssured of worthiness we do not dreadCompetitors we rather give them hailAnd greeting in the lists where we may failMust, if we bear an aim beyond the head!My betters are my masters purely fedBy their sustainment I likewise shall scaleSome rocky steps between the mount and valeMeanwhile the mark I have and I will wed.
So that I draw the breath of finer air,Station is nought, nor footways laurelstrewn,Nor rivals tightly belted for the race.
Good speed to them! My place is here or thereMy pride is that among them I have placeAnd thus I keep this instrument in tune.
GRACE AND LOVETwo flowerenfolding crystal vases sheI love fills daily, mindful but of oneAnd close behind pale morn she, like the sunPriming our world with light, pours, sweet to see,Clear water in the cup, and into meThe image of herself and that being done,Choice of what blooms round her fair garden runIn climbers or in creepers or the treeShe ranges with unerring fingers fine,To harmony so vivid that through sightI hear, I have her heavenliness to foldBeyond the senses, where such love as mine,Such grace as hers, should the strange Fates withholdTheir starry more from her and me, unite.
APPRECIATIONEarth was not Earth before her sons appeared,Nor Beauty Beauty ere young Love was bornAnd thou when I lay hidden wast as mornAt citywindows, touching eyelids blearedTo none by her fresh wingedness endearedUnwelcome unto revellers outworn.
I the last echoes of Dianas hornIn woodland heard, and saw thee come, and cheered.
No longer wast thou then mere light, fair soul!And more than simple duty moved thy feet.
New colours rose in thee, from fear, from shame,From hope, effused though not less pure a scrollMay men read on the heart I taught to beatThat change in thee, if not thyself, I claim.
THE DISCIPLINE OF WISDOMRich labour is the struggle to be wise,While we make sure the struggle cannot cease.
Else better were it in some bower of peaceSlothful to swing, contending with the flies.
You point at Wisdom fixed on lofty skies,As mid barbarian hordes a sculptured GreeceShe falls.
 To live and shine, she grows her fleece,Is shorn, and rubs with follies and with lies.
So following her, your hewing may attainThe right to speak unto the mute, and shunThat sly temptation of the illumined brain,Deliveries oracular, selfspun.
Who sweats not with the flock will seek in vainTo shed the words which are ripe fruit of sun.
THE STATE OF AGERub thou thy battered lamp nor claim nor begHonours from aught about thee.
 Light the young.
Thy frame is as a dusty mantle hung,O grey one! pendant on a loosened peg.
Thou art for this our life an ancient egg,Or a tough bird thou hast a rudderless tongue,Turning dead trifles, like the cock of dung,Which runs, Times contrast to thy halting leg.
Nature, it is most sure, not thee admires.
But hast thou in thy season set her firesTo burn from Self to Spirit through the lash,Honoured the sons of Earth shall hold thee highYea, to spread light when thy proud letter IDrops prone and void as any thoughtless dash.
PROGRESSIn Progress you have little faith, say youMen will maintain dear interests, wreak base hates,By force, and gentle women choose their matesMost amorously from the gilded fighting crewThe human heart Bellonas mad hallooWill ever fire to dicing with the Fates.
Now at this time, says History, those two StatesStood ready their past wrestling to renew.
They sharpened arms and showed them, like the brutesWhose haunches quiver.
 But a yellow blightFell on their waxing harvests.
 They deferredThe bloody settlement of their disputesTill God should bless them better.
 They did right.
And naming Progress, both shall have the word.
THE WORLDS ADVANCEJudge mildly the tasked world and disinclineTo brand it, for it bears a heavy pack.
You have perchance observed the inebriates trackAt night when he has quitted the innsignHe plays diversions on the homeward line,Still that way bent albeit his legs are slackA hedge may take him, but he turns not back,Nor turns this burdened world, of curving spine.
Spiral, the memorable Lady termsOur minds ascent our worlds advance presentsThat figure on a flat the way of worms.
Cherish the promise of its good intents,And warn it, not one instinct to effaceEre Reason ripens for the vacant place.
A CERTAIN PEOPLEAs Puritans they prominently wax,And none more kindly gives and takes hard knocks.
Strong psalmic chanting, like to nasal cocks,They join to thunderings of their hearty thwacks.
But naughtiness, with hoggery, not lacksWhen Peace another door in them unlocks,Where conscience shows the eyeing of an oxGrown dully apprehensive of an Axe.
Graceless they are when gone to frivolousness,Fearing the God they flout, the God they glut.
They need their pious exercises lessThan schooling in the Pleasures fair beliefThat these are devilish only to their thief,Charged with an Axe nigh on the occiput.
THE GARDEN OF EPICURUSThat Garden of sedate PhilosophyOnce flourished, fenced from passion and mishap,A shining spot upon a shaggy mapWhere mind and body, in fair junction free,Luted their joyful concord like the treeFrom root to flowering twigs a flowing sap.
Clear Wisdom found in tended Natures lapOf gentlemen the happy nursery.
That Garden would on light supremest verge,Were the long drawing of an equal breathHealthful for Wisdoms head, her heart, her aims.
Our world which for its Babels wants a scourge,And for its wilds a husbandman, acclaimsThe crucifix that came of Nazareth.
A LATER ALEXANDRIANAn inspiration caught from dubious huesFilled him, and mystic wrynesses he chasedFor they lead farther than the singlefaced,Wave subtler promise when desire pursues.
The moon of cloud discoloured was his Muse,His pipe the reed of the old moaning waste.
Love was to him with anguish fast enlaced,And Beauty where she walked bloodshot the dews.
Men railed at such a singer women thrilledResponsively he sang not Natures ownDivinest, but his lyric had a tone,As twere a forestecho of her voiceWhat barrenly they yearn for seemed distilledFrom what they dread, who do through tears rejoice.
AN ORSON OF THE MUSEHer son, albeit the Muses liveryAnd measured courtly paces rouse his taunts,Naked and hairy in his savage haunts,To Nature only will he bend the kneeSpouting the founts of her distilleryLike rough rocksources and his woes and wantsBeing Natures, civil limitation dauntsHis utterance never the nymphs blush, not he.
Him, when he blows of Earth, and Man, and Fate,The Muse will hearken to with graver earThan many of her train can waken himWould fain have taught what fruitful things and dearMust sink beneath the tidewaves, of their weight,If in no vessel built for sea they swim.
THE POINT OF TASTEUnhappy poets of a sunken prime!You to reviewers are as ball to bat.
They shadow you with Homer, knock you flatWith Shakespeare bludgeons brainingly sublimeOn you the excommunicates of Rhyme,Because you sing not in the living Fat.
The wiry whizz of an intrusive gnatIs verse that shuns their selfproducing time.
Sound them their clocks, with loud alarum trump,Or watches ticking temporal at their fobs,You win their pleased attention.
 But, bright GodO the lyre, what bullydrawlers they applaud!Rather for us a taverncatch, and bumpChorus where Lumpkin with his Giles hobnobs.
CAMELUS SALTATWhat say you, critic, now you have becomeAn author and maternalin this trapTo quote you of poor hollow folk who rapOn instruments as like as drum to drum.
You snarled tuttut for welcome to tumtum,So like the nose flyteased in its noons nap.
You scratched an insectslaughtering thunderclapWith that between the fingers and the thumb.
It seemeth mad to quit the Olympian couch,Which bade our public gobble or reject.
O spectacle of Peter, shrewdly pecked,Piper, by his own pepper from his pouch!What of the sneer, the jeer, the voice austere,You dealtthe voice austere, the jeer, the sneer.
CONTINUEDOracle of the market! thence you drewThe taste which stamped you guide of the inept.
 A Northsea pilot, Hildebrand yclept,A sturdy and a briny, once men knew.
He loved small beer, and for that copious brew,To roll ingurgitation till he slept,Rations exchanged with flavour for the adeptAnd merrily plied him captain, mate and crew.
At last this dancer to the Polar starSank, washed out within, and overboard was pitched,To drink the sea and pilot him to land.
O captaincritic! printed, neatly stitched,Know while the pilloryeggs fly fast, they areNot eggs, but the drowned soul of Hildebrand.
MY THEMEOf me and of my theme think what thou wiltThe song of gladness one straight bolt can check.
But I have never stood at Fortunes beckWere she and her light crew to run atiltAt my poor holding little would be spiltSmall were the praise for singing oer that wreck.
Who courts her dooms to strife his bended neckHe grasps a blade, not always by the hilt.
Nathless she strikes at random, can be fellWith other than those votaries she dealsThe black or brilliant from her thunderrift.
I say but that this love of Earth revealsA soul beside our own to quicken, quell,Irradiate, and through ruinous floods uplift.
CONTINUEDTis true the wisdom that my mind exactsThrough contemplation from a heart unbentBy many tempests may be stained and rentThe summer flies it mightily attracts.
Yet they seem choicer than your sons of facts,Which scarce give breathing of the stys contentFor their diurnal carnal nourishmentWhich treat with Nature in official pacts.
The deader body Nature could proclaim.
Much life have neither.
 Let the heavens of wrathRattle, then both scud scattering to froth.
But during calms the flies of idle aimLess put the spirit out, less baffle thirstFor light than swinish grunters, blest or curst.
ON THE DANGER OF WARAvert, High Wisdom, never vainly wooed,This threat of War, that shows a land brainsick.
When nations gain the pitch where rhetoricSeems reason they are ripe for cannons food.
Dark looms the issue though the cause be good,But with the doubt tis our old devils trick.
O now the downslope of the lunaticIllumine lest we redden of that brood.
For not since man in his first view of theeAscended to the heavens giving signWithin him of deep sky and sounded sea,Did he unforfeiting thy laws transgressIn peril of his blood his ears inclineTo drums whose loudness is their emptiness.
TO CARDINAL MANNINGI, wakeful for the skylark voice in men,Or straining for the angel of the light,Rebuked am I by hungry ear and sight,When I behold one lamp that through our fenGoes hourly where most noisome hear againA tongue that loathsomeness will not affrightFrom speaking to the soul of us forthrightWhat things our craven senses keep from ken.
This is the doing of the Christ the wayHe went on earth the service above guileTo prop a tyrant creed it sings, it shinesCries to the Mammonites Allay, allaySuch misery as by these present signsBrings vengeance down nor them who rouse revile.
TO COLONEL CHARLES DYING GENERAL C.

B.
IAn English heart, my commandant,A soldiers eye you have, awakeTo right and left with looks askantOn bulwarks not of adamant,Where white our Channel waters break.
IIWhere Grisnez winks at DungenessAcross the ruffled strip of salt,You look, and like the prospect less.
On men and guns would you lay stress,To bid the Islands foemen halt.
IIIWhile loud the Year is raising cryAt birth to know if it must bearIn history the bloody dye,An English heart, a soldiers eye,For the old country first will care.
IVAnd how stands she, artillerist,Among the vapours waxing dense,With cannon charged Tis hist! and hist!And now she screws a gouty fist,And now she counts to clutch her pence.
VWith shudders chill as aconite,The couchant chewer of the cudWill start at times in pussy frightBefore the dogs, when reads her spriteThe streaks predicting streams of blood.
VIShe thinks they may mean something thinksThey may mean nothing haply both.
Where darkness all her daylight drinks,She fain would find a leader lynx,Not too much taxing mental sloth.
VIICleft like the fated house in twain,One half is, Arm! and one, Retrench!Gambettas word on dull MacMahonThe cow that sees a passing trainSo spies she Russian, German, French.
VIIIShe no, her weakness she unbracedAmong those athletes fronting storms!The muscles less of steel than paste,Why, they of nature feel distasteFor flash, much more for push, of arms.
IXThe poet sings, and well know we,That iron draws men after it.
But towering wealth may seem the treeWhich bears the fruit INDEMNITY,And draw as fast as battles fit,XIf feeble be the hand on guard,Alas, alas! And nations areStill the mad forces, though the scarred.
Should they once deem our emblem PardWagger of tail for all save war XIMechanically screwed to flailHis flanks by Presses conjuring fear A moneybag with head and tail Too late may valour then avail!As you beheld, my cannonier,XIIWhen with the staff of Benedek,On the plateau of Koniggratz,You saw below that wedgeing speckForesaw proud Austria rammed to wreck,Where Chlum drove deep in smoky jets.

TO CHILDREN FOR TYRANTSIStrike not thy dog with a stick!I did it yesterdayNot to undo though I gainedThe Paradise heavy it rainedOn Kobolds flanks, and he lay.
IILittle Bruno, our longear pup,From his hunt had come back to my heel.
I heard a sharp worrying sound,And Bruno foamed on the ground,With Koby as making a meal.
IIII did what I could not undoWere the gates of the Paradise shutBehind me I deemed it was just.
I left Koby crouched in the dust,Some yards from the woodmans hut.
IVHe bewhimpered his welting, and IScarce thought it enough for him so,By degrees, through the upper boxgrove,Within me an old story hove,Of a man and a dog you shall know.
VThe dog was of novel breed,The Shannon retriever, untriedHis master, an old Irish lord,In an oaken armchair snoredAt midnight, whisky beside.
VIPerched up a desolate tower,Where the black stormwind was a whipTo set it nigh spinning, these twoWere alone, like the last of a crew,Outworn in a wavebeaten ship.
VIIThe dog lifted muzzle, and sniffedHe quitted his couch on the rug,Nose to floor, nose aloft whined, barkedAnd, finding the signals unmarked,Caught a hand in a deathgrapple tug.
VIIIHe pulled till his master jumpedFor fury of wrath, and laid onWith the length of a tough knotted staff,Fit to drive the life flying like chaff,And leave a sheer carcase anon.
IXThat done, he sat, panted, and cursedThe vile cross of this brute nevermoreWould he house it to rear such a cur!The dog dragged his legs, pained to stir,Eyed his master, dropped, barked at the door.
XThen his master raised head too, and sniffedIt struck him the dog had a senseThat honoured both dam and sire.
You have guessed how the tower was afire.
The Shannon retriever dates thence.
XII mused saw the pup ease his heartOf his instinct for chasing, and sinkOverwrought by excitement so newA scene that for Koby to viewWas the seizure of nerves in a link.
XIIAnd part sympathetic, and partImitatively, raged my poor bruteAnd I, not thinking of ill,Doing eviller nerves are stillOur savage too quick at the root.
XIIIThey spring us I proved it, albeitI played executioner thenFor discipline, justice, the like.
Yon stick I had handy to strikeShould have warned of the tyrant in men.
XIVYou read in your History books,How the Prince in his youth had a mindFor governing gently his land.
Ah, the use of that weapon at hand,When the temper is other than kind!XVAt home all was well Kobys ribsNot so sore as my thoughts if, beguiled,He forgives me, his criminal airThrows a shade of Llewellyns despairFor the hound slain for saving his child.
THE WOODS OF WESTERMAINIEnter these enchanted woods,You who dare.
Nothing harms beneath the leavesMore than waves a swimmer cleaves.
Toss your heart up with the lark,Foot at peace with mouse and worm,Fair you fare.
Only at a dread of darkQuaver, and they quit their formThousand eyeballs under hoodsHave you by the hair.
Enter these enchanted woods,You who dare.
IIHere the snake across your pathStretches in his golden bathMossyfooted squirrels leapSoft as winnowing plumes of SleepYaffles on a chuckle skimLow to laugh from branches dimUp the pine, where sits the star,Rattles deep the mothwinged jar.
Each has business of his ownBut should you distrust a tone,Then beware.
Shudder all the haunted roods,All the eyeballs under hoodsShroud you in their glare.
Enter these enchanted woods,You who dare.
IIIOpen hither, open hence,Scarce a bramble weaves a fence,Where the strawberry runs red,With white starflower overheadCumbered by dry twig and cone,Shredded husks of seedlings flown,Mine of mole and spotted flintOf dire wizardry no hint,Save mayhap the print that showsHasty outwardtripping toes,Heels to terror on the mould.
These, the woods of Westermain,Are as others to behold,Rich of wreathing sun and rainFoliage lustreful aroundShadowed leagues of slumbering sound.
Wavy treetops, yellow whins,Shelter eager minikins,Myriads, free to peck and pipeWould you better would you worseYou with them may gather ripePleasures flowing not from purse.
Quick and far as Colour fliesTaking the delighted eyes,You of any well that springsMay unfold the heaven of thingsHave it homely and within,And thereof its likeness win,Will you so in souls desireThis do sages grant t the lyre.
This is being bird and more,More than glad musician thisGranaries you will have a storePast the world of woe and blissSharing still its bliss and woeHarnessed to its hungers, no.
On the throne Success usurps,You shall seat the joy you feelWhere a race of water chirps,Twisting hues of flourished steelOr where light is caught in hoopUp a clearings leafy rise,Where the crossing deerherds troopClassic splendours, knightly dyes.
Or, where oldeyed oxen chewSpeculation with the cud,Read their pool of vision through,Back to hours when mind was mudNigh the knot, which did untwineTimelessly to drowsy sunsSeeing Earth a slimy spine,Heaven a space for winging tons.
Farther, deeper, may you read,Have you sight for things afield,Where peeps she, the Nurse of seed,Cloaked, but in the peep revealedShowing a kind face and sweetLook you with the soul you seet.
Glory narrowing to grace,Grace to glory magnified,Following that will you embraceClose in arms or aery wide.
Banished is the white FoambornNot from here, nor under banPhoebus lyrist, Phoebes horn,Pipings of the reedy Pan.
Loved of Earth of old they were,Loving did interpret herAnd the sterner worship barsNone whom Song has made her stars.
You have seen the huntress moonRadiantly facing dawn,Dusky meads between them strewnGlimmering like downy awnArgent Westward glows the hunt,East the blush about to climbOne another fair they front,Transient, yet outshine the timeEven as dewlight off the roseIn the mind a jewel sows.
Thus opposing grandeurs liveHere if Beauty be their dowerDoth she of her spirit give,Fleetingness will spare her flower.
This is in the tune we play,Which no spring of strength would quellIn subduing does not slayGuides the channel, guards the wellTempered holds the young bloodheat,Yet through measured grave accord,Hears the heart of wildness beatLike a centaurs hoof on sward.
Drink the sense the notes infuse,You a larger self will findSweetest fellowship ensuesWith the creatures of your kind.
Ay, and Love, if Love it beFlaming over I and ME,Love meet they who do not shoveCravings in the van of Love.
Courtly dames are here to woo,Knowing love if it be true.
Reverence the blossomshootFervently, they are the fruit.
Mark them stepping, hear them talk,Goddess, is no myth inane,You will say of those who walkIn the woods of Westermain.
Waters that from throat and thighDart the sun his arrows backLeaves that on a woodland sighChat of secret things no lackShadowy branchleaves, waters clear,Bare or veiled they move sincereNot by slavish terrors trippedBeing anew in nature dipped,Growths of what they step on, theseWith the roots the grace of trees.
Casketbreasts they give, nor hide,For a tyrants flattered pride,Mind, which nourished not by light,Lurks the shuffling trickster spriteWhereof are strange tales to tellSome in blood writ, tombed in bell.
Here the ancient battle ends,Joining two astonished friends,Who the kiss can give and takeWith more warmth than in that worldWhere the tiger claws the snake,Snake her tiger clasps infurled,And the issue of their fightPeople lands in snarling plight.
Here her splendid beast she leadsSilkenleashed and decked with weedsWild as he, but breathing faintSweetness of unfelt constraint.
Love, the great volcano, flingsFires of lower Earth to skyLove, the sole permitted, singsSovereignly of ME and I.
Bowers he has of sacred shade,Spaces of superb parade,Voiceful .
 .
 .
 But bring you a noteWrangling, howsoeer remote,Discords out of discord spinRound and round derisive dinSudden will a pallor pantChill at screeches miscreantOwls or spectres, thick they fleeNightmare upon horror broodsHooded laughter, monkish glee,Gaps the vital air.
Enter these enchanted woodsYou who dare.
IVYou must love the light so wellThat no darkness will seem fell.
Love it so you could accostFellowly a livid ghost.
Whish! the phantom wisps away,Owns him smoke to cocks of day.
In your breast the light must burnFed of you, like corn in quernEver plumping while the wheelSpeeds the mill and drains the meal.
Light to light sees little strange,Only features heavenly newThen you touch the nerve of Change,Then of Earth you have the clueThen her twosexed meanings meltThrough you, wed the thought and felt.
Sameness locks no scurfy pondHere for Custom, crazyfondChange is on the wing to budRose in brain from rose in blood.
Wisdom throbbing shall you seeCentral in complexityFrom her pasture mid the beastsRise to her ethereal feasts,Not, though lightnings track your witStarward, scorning them you quitFor be sure the bravest wingPreens it in our common spring,Thence along the vault to soar,You with others, gathering more,Glad of more, till you rejectYour proud title of elect,Perilous even here while fewRoam the arched greenwood with you.
Heed that snare.
Muffled by his caverncowlSquats the scaly Dragonfowl,Who was lord ere light you drank,And lest blood of knightly rankStream, let not your fair princessStray he holds the leagues in stress,Watches keenly there.
Oft has he been riven slainIs no force in Westermain.
Wait, and we shall forge him curbs,Put his fangs to uses, tame,Teach him, quick as cunning herbs,How to cure him sick and lame.
Much restricted, much enringed,Much he frets, the hooked and winged,Never known to spare.
Tis enough the name of SageHits no thing in nature, noughtMan the least, save when grave AgeFrom yon Dragon guards his thought.
Eye him when you hearken dumbTo what words from Wisdom come.
When she says how few are byListening to her, eye his eye.
Self, his name declare.
Him shall Change, transforming late,Wonderously renovate.
Hug himself the creature mayWhat he hugs is loathed decay.
Crying, slip thy scales, and slough!Change will strip his armour offMake of him who was all maw,Inly only thrillingshrewd,Such a servant as none sawThrough his days of dragonhood.
Days when growling oer his bone,Sharpened he for mine and thineSensitive within aloneScaly as the bark of pine.
Change, the strongest son of Life,Has the Spirit here to wife.
Lo, their young of vivid breed,Bear the lights that onward speed,Threading thickets, mounting glades,Up the verdurous colonnades,Round the fluttered curves, and down,Out of sight of Earths blue crown,Whither, in her central space,Spouts the Fount and Lure o the chase.
Fount unresting, Lure divine!There meet all too late look most.
Fire in water hued as wine,Springs amid a shadowy host,Circled one closeheaded mob,Breathless, scanning divers heaps,Where a Heart begins to throb,Where it ceases, slow, with leaps.
And tis very strange, tis said,How you spy in each of themSemblance of that Dragon red,As the oak in brackenstem.
And, tis said, how each and eachWhich commences, which subsidesFirst my Dragon! doth beseechHer who food for all provides.
And she answers with no signUtters neither yea nor nayFires the water hued as wineKneads another spark in clay.
Terror is about her hidSilence of the thunders lockedLightnings lining the shut lidFixity on quaking rocked.
Lo, you look at Flow and DroughtInterflashed and interwroughtEnded is begun, begunEnded, quick as torrents run.
Young Impulsion spouts to sinkLuridness and lustre linkTis your come and go of breathMirrored pants the Life, the DeathEach of either reaped and sownRosiest rosy wanes to crone.
See you so your senses driftTis a shuttle weaving swift.
Look with spirit past the sense,Spirit shines in permanence.
That is She, the view of whomIs the dust within the tomb,Is the inner blush above,Look to loathe, or look to loveThink her Lump, or know her FlameDread her scourge, or read her aimShoot your hungers from their nerveOr, in her example, serve.
Some have found her sitting graveLaughing, some or, browed with sweat,Hurling dust of fool and knaveIn a hissing smithys jet.
More it were not well to speakBurn to see, you need but seek.
Once beheld she gives the keyAiring every doorway, she.
Little can you stop or steerEre of her you are the seer.
On the surface she will witch,Rendering Beauty yours, but gazeUnder, and the soul is richPast computing, past amaze.
Then is courage that enduresEven her awful tremble yours.
Then, the reflex of that FountSpied below, will Reason mountLordly and a quenchless force,Lighting Pain to its mad source,Scaring Fear till Fear escapes,Shot through all its phantom shapes.
Then your spirit will perceiveFleshly seed of fleshly sinsWhere the passions interweave,How the serpent tangle spinsOf the sense of Earth misprised,Brainlessly unrecognizedShe being Spirit in her clods,Footway to the God of Gods.
Then for you are pleasures pure,Sureties as the stars are sureNot the wanton beckoning flagsWhich, of flattery and delight,Wax to the grim HabitHagsRiding souls of men to nightPleasures that through blood run sane,Quickening spirit from the brain.
Each of each in sequent birth,Blood and brain and spirit, three,Say the deepest gnomes of Earth,Join for true felicity.
Are they parted, then expectSome one sailing will be wreckedSeparate hunting are they sped,Scan the morsel coveted.
Earth that Triad is she hidesJoy from him who that dividesShowers it when the three are oneGlassing her in union.
Earth your haven, Earth your helm,You command a double realmLabouring here to pay your debt,Till your little sun shall setLeaving her the future taskLoving her too well to ask.
Eglantine that climbs the yew,She her darkest wreathes for thoseKnowing her the Evernew,And themselves the kin o the rose.
Life, the chisel, axe and sword,Wield who have her depths exploredLife, the dream, shall be their robeLarge as air about the globeLife, the question, hear its cryEchoed with concordant WhyLife, the small selfdragon ramped,Thrill for service to be stamped.
Ay, and over every heightLife for them shall wave a wandThat, the last, where sits affright,Homely shows the stream beyond.
Love the light and be its lynx,You will track her and attainRead her as no cruel SphinxIn the woods of Westermain,Daily fresh the woods are rangedGlooms which otherwhere appal,Sounded here, their worths exchangedUrban joins with pastoralLittle lost, save what may dropHusklike, and the mind preserves.
Natural overgrowths they lop,Yet from nature neither swerves,Trained or savage for this causeOf our Earth they ply the laws,Have in Earth their feeding root,Mind of man and bent of brute.
Hear that song both wild and ruled.
Hear it is it wail or mirthOrdered, bubbled, quite unschooledNone, and all it springs of Earth.
O but hear it! tis the mindMind that with deep Earth unites,Round the solid trunk to windRings of clasping parasites.
Music have you there to feedSimplest and most soaring need.
Free to wind, and in desireWinding, they to her attachedFeel the trunk a spring of fire,And ascend to heights unmatched,Whence the tidal world is viewedAs a sea of windy wheat,Momently black, barren, rudeGoldenbrown, for harvest meet,Dragonreaped from follysownBridelike to the sicklebladeQuick it varies, while the moan,Moan of a sad creature strayed,Chiefly is its voice.
 So fleshConjures tempestflails to threshGood from worthless.
 Some clear lampsLight it more of dead marshdamps.
Monster is it still, and blind,Fit but to be led by Pain.
Glance we at the paths behind,Fruitful sight has Westermain.
There we laboured, and in turnForward our blown lamps discern,As you see on the dark deepFar the loftier billows leap,Foam for beacon bear.
Hither, hither, if you will,Drink instruction, or instil,Run the woods like vernal sap,Crying, hail to luminousness!But have care.
In yourself may lurk the trapOn conditions they caress.
Here you meet the light invokedHere is never secret cloaked.
Doubt you with the monsters fryAll his orbit may excludeAre you of the stiff, the dry,Cursing the not understoodGrasp you with the monsters clawsGovern with his truncheonsawsHate, the shadow of a grainYou are lost in WestermainEarthward swoops a vulture sun,Nighted upon carrionStraightway venom winecups shoutToasts to One whose eyes are outFlowers along the reeling floorDrip henbane and helleboreBeauty, of her tresses shorn,Shrieks as natures maniacHideousness on hoof and hornTumbles, yapping in her trackHaggard Wisdom, stately once,Leers fantastical and tripsAllegory drums the sconce,Impiousness nibblenips.
Imp that dances, imp that flits,Imp o the demongrowing girl,Maddest! whirl with imp o the pitsRound you, and with them you whirlFast where pours the fountainroutOut of Him whose eyes are outMultitudes on multitudes,Drenched in wallowing devilryAnd you ask where you may be,In what reek of a lairGiven to bones and ogrebroodsAnd they yell you Where.

A BALLAD OF PAST MERIDIANILast night returning from my twilight walkI met the grey mist Death, whose eyeless browWas bent on me, and from his hand of chalkHe reached me flowers as from a withered boughO Death, what bitter nosegays givest thou!IIDeath said, I gather, and pursued his way.
Another stood by me, a shape in stone,Swordhacked and ironstained, with breasts of clay,And metal veins that sometimes fiery shoneO Life, how naked and how hard when known!IIILife said, As thou hast carved me, such am I.
Then memory, like the nightjar on the pine,And sightless hope, a woodlark in night sky,Joined notes of Death and Life till nights declineOf Death, of Life, those inwound notes are mine.
THE DAY OF THE DAUGHTER OF HADESIHe who has looked upon EarthDeeper than flower and fruit,Losing some hue of his mirth,As the tree striking rock at the root,Unto him shall the marvellous taleOf Callistes more humanly comeWith the touch on his breast than a hailFrom the markets that hum.
IINow the youth footed swift to the dawn.
Twas the season when wintertide,In the higher rockhollows updrawn,Leaves meadows to bud, and he spied,By light throwing shallow shade,Between the beam and the gloom,Sicilian Enna, whose MaidSuch aspect wears in her bloomUnderneath since the CharioteerOf Darkness whirled her away,On a reaped afternoon of the year,Nigh the poppydroop of Day.
O and naked of her, all dust,The majestic Mother and Nurse,Ringing cries to the God, the Just,Curled the land with the blight of her curseRecollected of this glad isleStill quaking.
 But now more fair,And momently fraying the whileThe veil of the shadows there,Soft Enna that prostrate griefSang through, and revealed round the vines,Bronzeorange, the crisp young leaf,The wheatblades tripping in lines,A hue unillumined by sunOf the flowers flooding grass as from fountsAll the penetrable dunOf the morn ere she mounts.
IIINor had saffron and sapphire and redWaved aloft to their sisters below,When gaped by the rockchannel headOf the lake, black, a cave at one blow,Reverberant over the plainA sound oft fearfully swungFor the coming of wrathful rainAnd forth, like the dragontongueOf a fire beaten flat by the gale,But more as the smoke to behold,A chariot burst.
 Then a wailQuivered high of the love that would foldBliss immeasurable, bigger than heart,Though a Gods and the wheels were stayed,And the team of the chariot swartReared in marble, the six, dismayed,Like hoofs that by night plashing seaCurve and ramp from the vast swanwaveFor, lo, the Great Mother, She!And Callistes gazed, he gaveHis eyeballs up to the sightThe embrace of the Twain, of whomTo men are their day, their night,Mellow fruits and the shearing tombOur Lady of the SheavesAnd the Lily of Hades, the SweetOf Enna he saw through leavesThe Mother and Daughter meet.
They stood by the chariotwheel,Embraced, very tall, most likeFellow poplars, windtaken, that reelDown their shivering columns and strikeHead to head, crossing throats and apart,For the feast of the look, they drew,Which Darkness no longer could thwartAnd they broke together anew,Exulting to tears, flower and bud.
But the mate of the Rayless was graveShe smiled like Sleep on its flood,That washes of all we craveLike the trance of eyes awakeAnd the spirit enshrouded, she castThe wan underworld on the lake.
They were so, and they passed.
IVHe tells it, who knew the lawUpon mortals he stood aliveDeclaring that this he sawHe could see, and survive.
VNow the youth was not ware of the beamsWith the grasses intertwined,For each thing seen, as in dreams,Came stepping to rear through his mind,Till it struck his remembered prayerTo be witness of this which had flownLike a smoke melted thinner than air,That the vacancy doth disown.
And viewing a maiden, he thoughtIt might now be morn, and afarWithin him the memory wroughtOf a something that slipped from the carWhen those, the august, moved byPerchance a scarf, and perchanceThis maiden.
 She did not fly,Nor started at his advanceShe looked, as when infinite thirstPants pausing to bless the springs,Refreshed, unsated.
 Then firstHe trembled with awe of the thingsHe had seen and he did transfer,Divining and doubting in turn,His reverence unto herNor asked what he crouched to learnThe whence of her, whither, and whyHer presence there, and her name,Her parentage under which skyHer birth, and how hither she came,So young, a virgin, alone,Unfriended, having no fear,As Oreads have no moan,Like the lost upon earth no tearNot a sign of the torch in the blood,Though her stature had reached the heightWhen mantles a tender rudIn maids that of youths have sight,If maids of our seed they beFor he said A glad vision art thou!And she answered him Thou to me!As men utter a vow.
VIThen said she, quick as the criesOf the rainy cranes Light! light!And Helios rose in her eyes,That were full as the dewballs bright,Relucent to him as dewsUnshaded.
 Breathing, she sentHer voice to the God of the Muse,And along the vale it went,Strange to hear not thin, not shrillSweet, but no young maids throatThe echo beyond the hillRan falling on half the noteAnd under the shaken groundWhere the Hundredheaded groansBy the roots of great AEtna bound,As of him were hollow tonesOf wondering roared a taleRepeated to sunless halls.
But now off the face of the valeShadows fled in a breath, and the wallsOf the lakes rockhead were gold,And the breast of the lake, that swellOf the crestless long wave rolledTo shorebubble, pebble and shell.
A morning of radiant lidsOer the dance of the earth opened wideThe bees chose their flowers, the snub kidsUpon hindlegs went sportive, or plied,Nosing, hard at the dugs to be filledThere was milk, honey, music to makeUp their branches the little birds billedChirrup, drone, bleat and buzz ringed the lake.
O shining in sunlight, chiefAfter water and waters caress,Was the young bronzeorange leaf,That clung to the tree as a tress,Shooting lucid tendrils to wedWith the vinehook tree or pole,Like Arachne launched out on her thread.
Then the maiden her dusky stoleIn the span of the blackstarred zone,Gathered up for her footing fleet.
As one that had toil of her ownShe followed the lines of wheatTripping straight through the fields, green blades,To the groves of olive grey,Downygrey, goldentinged and to gladesWhere the pearblossom thickens the sprayIn a night, like the snowpacked stormPear, apple, almond, plumNot wintry now pushing, warm!And she touched them with finger and thumb,As the vinehook closes she smiled,Recounting again and again,Corn, wine, fruit, oil! like a child,With the meaning known to men.
For hours in the track of the ploughAnd the pruningknife she stepped,And of how the seed works, and of howYields the soil, she seemed adept.
Then she murmured that name of the dearth,The Beneficent, Hers, who badeOur husbandmen sow for the birthOf the grain making earth full glad.
She murmured that Others the dirgeOf lifelight for whose dark lapOur locks are clipped on the vergeOf the realm where runs no sap.
She said We have looked on both!And her eyes had a wavering beamOf various lights, like the frothOf the stormswollen ravine streamIn flame of the bolt.
 What linksWere these which had made him her friendHe eyed her, as one who drinks,And would drink to the end.
VIINow the meadows with crocus besprent,And the asphodel woodsides she left,And the lakeslopes, the ravishing scentOf narcissus, darksweet, for the cleftThat tutors the torrentbrook,Delaying its forceful spleenWith many a wind and crookThrough rock to the broad ravine.
By the hyacinthbells in the brakes,And the shadeloved white windflower, half hid,And the sunloving lizards and snakesOn the clefts barren ledges, that slidOut of sight, smooth as waterdrops, all,At a snap of twig or barkIn the track of the foreign footfall,She climbed to the pineforest dark,Overbrowing an emerald chineOf the grassbillows.
 Thence, as a wreath,Running poplar and cypress to pine,The lakebanks are seen, and beneath,Vineyard, village, groves, rivers, towers, farms,The citadel watching the bay,The bay with the town in its arms,The town shining white as the sprayOf the sapphire seawave on the rock,Where the rock stars the girdle of sea,Whiteringed, as the midday flock,Clipped by heat, rings the round of the tree.
That hour of the piercing shaftTransfixes boughshadows, confusedIn veins of fire, and she laughed,With her quiet mouth amusedTo see the whole flock, adroop,Asleep, hug the treestem as one,Imperceptibly filling the loopOf its shade at a slant of sun.
The pipes under pent of the crag,Where the goatherds in piping recline,Have whimsical stops, burst and flagUncorrected as outstretched swineFor the fingers are slack and unsure,And the wind issues querulous thornsAnd snakes!but she listened demure,Comparing days music with morns.
Of the gentle spirit that slipsFrom the bark of the tree she discoursed,And of her of the wells, whose lipsAre coolness enchanting, rocksourced.
And much of the sacred loon,The frolic, the Goatfoot God,For stories of indolent noonIn the pineforests odorous nod,She questioned, not knowing he canBe waspish, irascible, rude,He is oftener friendly to man,And ever to beasts and their brood.
For the which did she love him well,She said, and his pipes of the reed,His twitched lips puffing to tellIn music his tears and his need,Against the sharp catch of his hurt.
Not as shepherds of Pan did she speak,Nor spake as the schools, to divert,But fondly, perceiving him weakBefore Gods, and to shepherds a fear,A holiness, horn and heel.
All this she had learnt in her earFrom Callistes, and taught him to feel.
Yea, the solemn divinity flushedThrough the shaggy brown skin of the beast,And the steeps where the cataract rushed,And the wilds where the forest is priest,Were his temple to clothe him in awe,While she spake twas a wonder she readThe haunts of the beak and the clawAs plain as the land of bread,But Cities and martial States,Whither soon the youth veered his theme,Were impervious barriergatesTo her and that ship, a trireme,Nearing harbour, scarce wakened her glance,Though he dwelt on the message it boreOf sceptre and sword and lanceTo the beeswarms black on the shore,Which were audible almost,So black they were.
 It befelThat he called up the warrior hostOf the Song pouring hydromelIn thunder, the widewinged Song.
And he named with his boyish prideThe heroes, the noble throngPast Acheron now, foul tide!With his joy of the godlike bandAnd the verse divine, he namedThe chiefs pressing hot on the strand,Seen of Gods, of Gods aided, and maimed.
The fleetfoot and ireful the KingHim, the prompter in stratagem,Manyshifted and masterful Sing,O Muse! But she cried Not of themShe breathed as if breath had failed,And her eyes, while she bade him desist,Held the losttolight ghosts greymailed,As you see the grey rivermistHold shapes on the yonder bank.
A moment her body waned,The light of her sprang and sankThen she looked at the sun, she regainedClear feature, and she breathed deep.
She wore the wan smile he had seen,As the flow of the river of Sleep,On the mouth of the ShadowQueen.
In sunlight she craved to bask,Saying Life! And who was she whoOf what issue He dared not ask,For that partly he knew.
VIIIA noise of the hollow groundTurned the eye to the ear in debateNot the soft overflowing of soundOf the pines, ranked, lofty, straight,Barely swayed to some whispers remote,Some swarming whispers aboveNot the pines with the faint airs afloat,Hushhushing the nested doveIt was not the pines, or the routOft heard from midforest in chase,But the long muffled roar of a shoutSubterranean.
 Sharp grew her face.
She rose, yet not moved by affrightTwas rather good haste to useHer holiday of delightIn the beams of the God of the Muse.
And the steeps of the forest she crossed,On its dry red sheddings and conesUp the paths by roots greenmossed,Spotted amber, and old mossed stones.
Then out where the brooktorrent startsTo her leap, and from bend to curveA hurrying elbow dartsFor the instantglancing swerve,Decisive, with violent willIn the action formed, like hers,The maidens, ascending and stillAscending, the bud of the furze,The broom, and all blueberried shootsOf stubborn and prickly kind,The juniper flat on its roots,The dwarf rhododaphne, behindShe left, and the mountain sheepFar behind, goat, herbage and flower.
The island was hers, and the deep,All heaven, a golden hour.
Then with wonderful voice, that rangThrough air as the swans nigh death,Of the glory of Light she sang,She sang of the rapture of Breath.
Nor ever, says he who heard,Heard Earth in her boundaries broad,From bosom of singer or birdA sweetness thus rich of the GodWhose harmonies always are sane.
She sang of furrow and seed,The burial, birth of the grain,The growth, and the showers that feed,And the green blades waxing matureFor the husbandmans armful brown.
O, the song in its burden ran pure,And burden to song was a crown.
Callistes, a singer, skilledIn the gift he could measure and praise,By a rivals art was thrilled,Though she sang but a Song of Days,Where the husbandmans toil and strifeLittle varies to strife and toilBut the milky kernel of life,With her numbered corn, wine, fruit, oilThe song did give him to eatGave the first rapt vision of Good,And the fresh young sense of SweetThe grace of the battle for food,With the issue Earth cannot refuseWhen men to their labour are sworn.
Twas a song of the God of the MuseTo the forehead of Morn.
IXHim loved she.
 Lo, now was he veiledOver sea stood a swelled cloudrackThe fishingboat heavenward sailed,Bent abeam, with a whitened track,Surprised, fast hauling the net,As it flew sea dashed, earth shook.
She said Is it night O not yet!With a travail of thoughts in her look.
The mountain heaved up to its peakSea darkened earth gathered her fowlOf bird or of branch rose the shriek.
Night but never so fell a scowlWore night, nor the sky since thenWhen ocean ran swallowing shore,And the Gods looked down for men.
Broke tempest with that stern roarNever yet, save when black on the whirlRode wrath of a sovereign Power.
Then the youth and the shuddering girl,Dim as shades in the angry shower,Joined hands and descended a mazeOf the paths that were racing aliveRound boulder and bush, cleaving ways,Incessant, with sound of a hive.
The height was a fountainurnPouring streams, and the whole solid heightLeaped, chasing at every turnThe pair in one spirit of flightTo the folding pineforest.
 Yet here,Like the pause to things hunted, in doubt,The stillness bred spectral fearOf the awfulness ranging without,And imminent.
 Downward they fled,From under the haunted roof,To the valley aquake with the treadOf an ironresounding hoof,As of legions of thunderful horseBroken loose and in line tramping hard.
For the rage of a hungry forceRoamed blind of its mark over swardThey saw it rush dense in the cloakOf its travelling swathe of steamAll the vale through a thin threadsmokeWas thrown back to distance extremeAnd dull the full breast of it blinked,Like a buckler of steel breathed oer,Diminished, in strangeness distinct,Glowing cold, unearthly, hoarAn Enna of fields beyond sun,Out of light, in a lurid webAnd the traversing fury spunUp and down with a waves flow and ebbAs the wave breaks to grasp and to spurn,Retire, and in ravenous greed,Inveterate, swell its return.
Up and down, as if wringing from speedSights that made the unsighted appear,Delude and dissolve, on it scoured.
Lo, a sea upon land held careerThrough the plain of the vale halfdevoured.
Callistes of home and escapeMuttered swiftly, unwitting of speech.
She gazed at the Void of shape,She put her white hand to his reach,Saying Now have we looked on the Three.
And divided from day, from night,From air that is breath, stood she,Like the vale, out of light.
XThen again in disorderly wordsHe muttered of home, and was mute,With the heart of the cowering birdsEre they burst off the fowlers foot.
He gave her some redness that streamedThrough her limbs in a flitting glow.
The sigh of our life she seemed,The bliss of it clothing in woe.
Frailer than flower when the roundOf the sickle encircles it strongTo tell of the things profound,Our inmost uttering song,Unspoken.
 So stood she awhileIn the gloom of the terror afield,And the silence about her smileSaid more than of tongue is revealed.
I have breathed I have gazed I have beenIt said and not joylessly shoneThe remembrance of light through the screenOf a face that seemed shadow and stone.
She led the youth trembling, appalled,To the lakebanks he saw sink and riseLike a panicstruck breast.
 Then she called,And the hurricane blackness had eyes.
It launched like the Thunderers bolt.
Pale she drooped, and the youth by her sideWould have clasped her and dared a revoltSacrilegious as ever defiedHigh Olympus, but vainly for strengthHis compassionate heart shook a frameStricken rigid to ice all its length.
On amain the black traveller came.
Lo, a chariot, cleaving the storm,Clove the fountaining lake with a plough,And the lord of the steeds was in formHe, the God of implacable brow,Darkness he he in person he ragedThrough the wave like a boar of the wildsFrom the hunters and hounds disengaged,And a name shouted hoarsely his childs.
Horror melted in anguish to hear.
Lo, the wave hissed apart for the pathOf the terrible Charioteer,With the foam and torn features of wrath,Hurled aloft on each arm in a sheetAnd the steeds clove it, rushing at landLike the teeth of the famished at meat.
Then he swept out his hand.
XIThis, no more, doth Callistes recallHe saw, ere he dropped in swoon,On the maiden the chariot fall,As a thundercloud swings on the moon.
Forth, free of the deluge, one cryFrom the vanishing gallop rose clearAnd Skiegeneia! the skyRang Skiegeneia! the sphere.
And she left him therewith, to rejoice,Repine, yearn, and know not his aim,The life of their day in her voice,Left her life in her name.
XIINow the valley in ruin of fieldsAnd fair meadowland, showing at eveLike the spearpitted warriors shieldsAfter battle, bade men believeThat no other than wrathfullest GodHad been loose on her beautiful breast,Where the flowery grass was clod,Wheat and vine as a trailing nest.
The valley, discreet in grief,Disclosed but the open truth,And Enna had hope of the sheafThere was none for the desolate youthDevoted to mourn and to crave.
Of the secret he had divinedOf his friend of a day would he raveHow for light of our earth she pinedFor the olive, the vine and the wheat,Burning through with inherited fireAnd when Mother went Mother to meet,She was prompted by simple desireIn the daydestined car to have placeAt the skirts of the Goddess, unseen,And be drawn to the dear earths face.
She was fire for the blue and the greenOf our earth, dark fire athirstAs a seed of her bosom for dawn,White air that had robed and nursedHer mother.
 Now was she goneWith the Silent, the God without tear,Like a bud peeping out of its sheathTo be sundered and stamped with the sere.
And Callistes to her beneath,As she to our beams, extinct,Strained arms he was shade of her shade.
In division so were they linked.
But the song which had betrayedHer flight to the cavernous earFor its own keenly wakeful that songOf the sowing and reaping, and cheerOf the husbandmans heart made strongThrough droughts and deluging rainsWith his faith in the Great Mothers loveO the joy of the breath she sustains,And the lyre of the light above,And the first rapt vision of Good,And the fresh young sense of SweetThat song the youth ever pursuedIn the track of her footing fleet.
For men to be profited muchBy her day upon earth did he singOf her voice, and her steps, and her touchOn the blossoms of tender Spring,Immortal and how in her soulShe is with them, and tearless abides,Folding grain of a love for one goalIn patience, past flowing of tides.
And if unto him she was tears,He wept not he wasted withinSeeming sane in the song, to his peers,Only crazed where the cravings begin.
Our Lady of Gifts prized he lessThan her issue in darkness the dimLost Skiegencias caressOf our earth made it richest for him.
And for that was a curse on him raised,And he withered rathe, dry to his prime,Though the bounteous Giver be praisedThrough the island with rites of old timeExceedingly fervent, and reapedVeneration for teachings devout,Pious hymns when the cornsheaves are heapedAnd the winepresses ruddily spout,And the olive and apple are juiceAt a touch light as hers lost below.
Whatsoever to men is of useSprang his worship of them who bestow,In a measure of songs unexcelledBut that soul loving earth and the sunFrom her home of the shadows he heldFor his beacon where beam there is noneAnd to join her, or have her brought back,In his frenzy the singer would call,Till he followed where never was track,On the path trod of all.
THE LARK ASCENDINGHe rises and begins to round,He drops the silver chain of sound,Of many links without a break,In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake,All intervolved and spreading wide,Like waterdimples down a tideWhere ripple ripple overcurlsAnd eddy into eddy whirlsA press of hurried notes that runSo fleet they scarce are more than one,Yet changeingly the trills repeatAnd linger ringing while they fleet,Sweet to the quick o the ear, and dearTo her beyond the handmaid ear,Who sits beside our inner springs,Too often dry for this he brings,Which seems the very jet of earthAt sight of sun, her musics mirth,As up he wings the spiral stair,A song of light, and pierces airWith fountain ardour, fountain play,To reach the shining tops of day,And drink in everything discernedAn ecstasy to music turned,Impelled by what his happy billDisperses drinking, showering still,Unthinking save that he may giveHis voice the outlet, there to liveRenewed in endless notes of glee,So thirsty of his voice is he,For all to hear and all to knowThat he is joy, awake, aglowThe tumult of the heart to hearThrough pureness filtered crystalclear,And know the pleasure sprinkled brightBy simple singing of delightShrill, irreflective, unrestrained,Rapt, ringing, on the jet sustainedWithout a break, without a fall,Sweetsilvery, sheer lyrical,Perennial, quavering up the chordLike myriad dews of sunny swardThat trembling into fulness shine,And sparkle dropping argentineSuch wooing as the ear receivesFrom zephyr caught in choric leavesOf aspens when their chattering netIs flushed to white with shivers wetAnd such the waterspirits chimeOn mountain heights in mornings prime,Too freshly sweet to seem excess,Too animate to need a stressBut wider over many headsThe starry voice ascending spreads,Awakening, as it waxes thin,The best in us to him akinAnd every face to watch him raised,Puts on the light of children praisedSo rich our human pleasure ripesWhen sweetness on sincereness pipes,Though nought be promised from the seas,But only a softruffling breezeSweep glittering on a still content,Serenity in ravishmentFor singing till his heaven fills,Tis love of earth that he instils,And ever winging up and up,Our valley is his golden cup,And he the wine which overflowsTo lift us with him as he goesThe woods and brooks, the sheep and kine,He is, the hills, the human line,The meadows green, the fallows brown,The dreams of labour in the townHe sings the sap, the quickened veinsThe wedding song of sun and rainsHe is, the dance of children, thanksOf sowers, shout of primrosebanks,And eye of violets while they breatheAll these the circling song will wreathe,And you shall hear the herb and tree,The better heart of men shall see,Shall feel celestially, as longAs you crave nothing save the song.
Was never voice of ours could sayOur inmost in the sweetest way,Like yonder voice aloft, and linkAll hearers in the song they drink.
Our wisdom speaks from failing blood,Our passion is too full in flood,We want the key of his wild noteOf truthful in a tuneful throatThe song seraphically freeOf taint of personality,So pure that it salutes the sunsThe voice of one for millions,In whom the millions rejoiceFor giving their one spirit voice.
Yet men have we, whom we revere,Now names, and men still housing here,Whose lives, by many a battledintDefaced, and grinding wheels on flint,Yield substance, though they sing not, sweetFor song our highest heaven to greetWhom heavenly singing gives us new,Enspheres them brilliant in our blue,From firmest base to farthest leap,Because their love of Earth is deep,And they are warriors in accordWith life to serve, and, pass reward,So touching purest and so heardIn the brains reflex of yon birdWherefore their soul in me, or mine,Through selfforgetfulness divine,In them, that song aloft maintains,To fill the sky and thrill the plainsWith showerings drawn from human stores,As he to silence nearer soars,Extends the world at wings and dome,More spacious making more our home,Till lost on his aerial ringsIn light, and then the fancy sings.
PHOEBUS WITH ADMETUSIWhen by Zeus relenting the mandate was revoked,Sentencing to exile the bright SunGod,Mindful were the ploughmen of who the steer had yoked,Who and what a track showed the upturned sod!Mindful were the shepherds, as now the noon severeBent a burning eyebrow to brown evetide,How the rustic flute drew the silver to the sphere,Sister of his own, till her rays fell wide.
God! of whom musicAnd song and blood are pure,The day is never darkenedThat had thee here obscure.
IIChirping none, the scarlet cicadas crouched in ranksSlack the thistlehead piled its downsilk greyScarce the stony lizard sucked hollows in his flanksThick on spots of umbrage our drowsed flocks lay.
Sudden bowed the chestnuts beneath a wind unheard,Lengthened ran the grasses, the sky grew slateThen amid a swift flight of winged seed white as curd,Clear of limb a Youth smote the masters gate.
God! of whom musicAnd song and blood are pure,The day is never darkenedThat had thee here obscure.
IIIWater, first of singers, oer rocky mount and mead,First of earthly singers, the sunloved rill,Sang of him, and flooded the ripples on the reed,Seeking whom to waken and what ear fill.
Water, sweetest soother to kiss a wound and cool,Sweetest and divinest, the skyborn brook,Chuckled, with a whimper, and made a mirrorpoolRound the guest we welcomed, the strange hand shook.
God! of whom musicAnd song and blood are pure,The day is never darkenedThat had thee here obscure.
IVMany swarms of wild bees descended on our fieldsStately stood the wheatstalk with head bent highBig of heart we laboured at storing mighty yields,Wool and corn, and clusters to make men cry!Handlike rushed the vintage we strung the bellied skinsPlump, and at the sealing the Youths voice roseMaidens clung in circle, on little fists their chinsGentle beasties through pushed a cold long nose.
God! of whom musicAnd song and blood are pure,The day is never darkenedThat had thee here obscure.
VFoot to fire in snowtime we trimmed the slender shaftOften down the pit spied the lean wolfs teethGrin against his will, trapped by masterstrokes of craftHelpless in his frothwrath as green logs seethe!Safe the tender lambs tugged the teats, and winter spedWhirled before the crocus, the years new gold.
Hung the hooky beak up aloft, the arrowheadReddened through his feathers for our dear fold.
God! of whom musicAnd song and blood are pure,The day is never darkenedThat had thee here obscure.
VITales we drank of giants at war with Gods aboveRocks were they to look on, and earth climbed air!Tales of search for simples, and those who sought of loveEase because the creature was all too fair.
Pleasant ran our thinking that while our work was good,Sure as fruits for sweat would the praise come fast.
He that wrestled stoutest and tamed the billowbroodDanced in rings with girls, like a sailflapped mast.
God! of whom musicAnd song and blood are pure,The day is never darkenedThat had thee here obscure.
VIILo, the herb of healing, when once the herb is known,Shines in shady woods bright as newsprung flame.
Ere the string was tightened we heard the mellow tone,After he had taught how the sweet sounds cameStretched about his feet, labour done, twas as you seeRed pomegranates tumble and burst hard rind.
So began contention to give delight and beExcellent in things aimed to make life kind.
God! of whom musicAnd song and blood are pure,The day is never darkenedThat had thee here obscure.
VIIIYou with shelly horns, rams! and, promontory goats,You whose browsing beards dip in coldest dew!Bulls, that walk the pastures in kinglyflashing coats!Laurel, ivy, vine, wreathed for feasts not few!You that build the shaderoof, and you that court the rays,You that leap besprinkling the rock streamrentHe has been our fellow, the morning of our days!Us he chose for housemates, and this way went.
God! of whom musicAnd song and blood are pure,The day is never darkenedThat had thee here obscure.
MELAMPUSIWith love exceeding a simple love of the thingsThat glide in grasses and rubble of woody wreckOr change their perch on a beat of quivering wingsFrom branch to branch, only restful to pipe and peckOr, bristled, curl at a touch their snouts in a ballOr cast their web between bramble and thorny hookThe good physician Melampus, loving them all,Among them walked, as a scholar who reads a book.
IIFor him the woods were a home and gave him the keyOf knowledge, thirst for their treasures in herbs and flowers.
The secrets held by the creatures nearer than weTo earth he sought, and the link of their life with oursAnd where alike we are, unlike where, and the veinedDivision, veined parallel, of a blood that flowsIn them, in us, from the source by man unattainedSave marks he well what the mystical woods disclose.
IIIAnd this he deemed might be boon of love to a breastEmbracing tenderly each little motive shape,The prone, the flitting, who seek their food whither bestTheir wits direct, whither best from their foes escape.
For closer drawn to our mothers natural milk,As babes they learn where her motherly help is greatThey know the juice for the honey, juice for the silk,And need they medical antidotes, find them straight.
IVOf earth and sun they are wise, they nourish their broods,Weave, build, hive, burrow and battle, take joy and painLike swimmers varying billows never in woodsRuns white insanity fleeing itself all saneThe woods revolve as the tree its shadowing limnsTo some resemblance in motion, the rooted lifeRestrains disorder you hear the primitive hymnsOf earth in woods issue wild of the web of strife.
VNow sleeping once on a day of marvellous fire,A brood of snakes he had cherished in grave regretThat death his people had dealt their dam and their sire,Through savage dread of them, crept to his neck, and setTheir tongues to lick him the swift affectionate tongueOf each ran licking the slumberer then his earsA forked red tongue tickled shrewdly sudden upsprung,He heard a voice piping Ay, for he has no fears!VIA bird said that, in the notes of birds, and the speechOf men, it seemed and another renewed He movesTo learn and not to pursue, he gathers to teachHe feeds his young as do we, and as we love loves.
No fears have I of a man who goes with his headTo earth, chance looking aloft at us, kind of handI feel to him as to earth of whom we are fedI pipe him much for his good could he understand.
VIIMelampus touched at his ears, laid finger on wristHe was not dreaming, he sensibly felt and heard.
Above, through leaves, where the treetwigs intertwist,He spied the birds and the bill of the speaking bird.
His cushion mosses in shades of various green,The lumped, the antlered, he pressed, while the sunny snakeSlipped under draughts he had drunk of clear Hippocrene,It seemed, and sat with a gift of the Gods awake.
VIIIDivinely thrilled was the man, exultingly full,As quick wellwaters that come of the heart of earth,Ere yet they dart in a brook are one bubblepoolTo light and sound, wedding both at the leap of birth.
The soul of light vivid shone, a stream within streamThe soul of sound from a musical shell outflewWhere others hear but a hum and see but a beam,The tongue and eye of the fountain of life he knew.
IXHe knew the Hours they were round him, laden with seedOf hours bestrewn upon vapour, and one by oneThey winged as ripened in fruit the burden decreedFor each to scatter they flushed like the buds in sun,Bequeathing seed to successive similar rings,Their sisters, bearers to men of what men have earnedHe knew them, talked with the yet unreddened the stings,The sweets, they warmed at their bosoms divined, discerned.
XNot unsolicited, sought by diligent feet,By riddling fingers expanded, oft watched in growthWith brooding deep as the noonrays quickening wheat,Ere touchd, the pendulous flower of the plants of sloth,The plants of rigidness, answered question and squeeze,Revealing wherefore it bloomed, uninviting, bent,Yet making harmony breathe of life and disease,The deeper chord of a wonderful instrument.
XISo passed he luminouseyed for earth and the fatesWe arm to bruise or caress us his ears were chargedWith tones of love in a whirl of voluble hates,With music wrought of distraction his heart enlarged.
Celestialshining, though mortal, singer, though mute,He drew the Master of harmonies, voiced or stilled,To seek him heard at the silent medicinerootA song, beheld in fulfilment the unfulfilled.
XIIHim Phoebus, lending to darkness colour and formOf lights excess, many lessons and counsels gave,Showed Wisdom lord of the human intricate swarm,And whence prophetic it looks on the hives that rave,And how acquired, of the zeal of love to acquire,And where it stands, in the centre of life a sphereAnd Measure, mood of the lyre, the rapturous lyre,He said was Wisdom, and struck him the notes to hear.
XIIISweet, sweet twas glory of vision, honey, the breezeIn heat, the run of the river on root and stone,All senses joined, as the sister PieridesAre one, uplifting their chorus, the Nine, his own.
In stately order, evolved of sound into sight,From sight to sound intershifting, the man descriedThe growths of earth, his adored, like day out of night,Ascend in song, seeing nature and song allied.
XIVAnd there vitality, there, there solely in song,Resides, where earth and her uses to men, their needs,Their forceful cravings, the theme are there is it strong,The Master said and the studious eye that reads,Yea, even as earth to the crown of Gods on the mount,In links divine with the lyrical tongue is bound.
Pursue thy craft it is music drawn of a fountTo spring perennial wellspring is common ground.
XVMelampus dwelt among men physician and sage,He served them, loving them, healing them sick or maimed,Or them that frenzied in some delirious rageOutran the measure, his juice of the woods reclaimed.
He played on men, as his master, Phoebus, on stringsMelodious as the God did he drive and check,Through love exceeding a simple love of the thingsThat glide in grasses and rubble of woody wreck.
LOVE IN THE VALLEYUnder yonder beechtree single on the greensward,Couched with her arms behind her golden head,Knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly,Lies my young love sleeping in the shade.
Had I the heart to slide an arm beneath her,Press her parting lips as her waist I gather slow,Waking in amazement she could not but embrace meThen would she hold me and never let me go  Shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow,Swift as the swallow along the rivers lightCircleting the surface to meet his mirrored winglets,Fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight.
Shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pinetops,Wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun,She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer,Hard, but O the glory of the winning were she won!  When her mother tends her before the laughing mirror,Tying up her laces, looping up her hair,Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded,More love should I have, and much less care.
When her mother tends her before the lighted mirror,Loosening her laces, combing down her curls,Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded,I should miss but one for the many boys and girls.
  Heartless she is as the shadow in the meadowsFlying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon.
No, she is athirst and drinking up her wonderEarth to her is young as the slip of the new moon.
Deals she an unkindness, tis but her rapid measure,Even as in a dance and her smile can heal no lessLike the swinging Maycloud that pelts the flowers with hailstonesOff a sunny border, she was made to bruise and bless.
  Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweepingWavy in the dusk lit by one large star.
Lone on the firbranch, his rattlenote unvaried,Brooding oer the gloom, spins the brown evejar.
Darker grows the valley, more and more forgettingSo were it with me if forgetting could be willed.
Tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling wellspring,Tell it to forget the source that keeps it filled.
  Stepping down the hill with her fair companions,Arm in arm, all against the raying West,Boldly she sings, to the merry tune she marches,Brave in her shape, and sweeter unpossessed.
Sweeter, for she is what my heart first awakingWhispered the world was morning light is she.
Love that so desires would fain keep her changelessFain would fling the net, and fain have her free.
  Happy happy time, when the white star hoversLow over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew,Near the face of dawn, that draws athwart the darkness,Threading it with colour, like yewberries the yew.
Thicker crowd the shades as the grave East deepensGlowing, and with crimson a long cloud swells.
Maiden still the morn is and strange she is, and secretStrange her eyes her cheeks are cold as cold seashells.
  Sunrays, leaning on our southern hills and lightingWild cloudmountains that drag the hills along,Oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughterChill as a dull face frowning on a song.
Ay, but shows the Southwest a ripplefeathered bosomBlown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascendScaling the midheavens as they stream, there comes a sunsetRich, deep like love in beauty without end.
  When at dawn she sighs, and like an infant to the windowTurns grave eyes craving light, released from dreams,Beautiful she looks, like a white waterlilyBursting out of bud in havens of the streams.
When from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankleIn her long nightgown sweet as boughs of May,Beautiful she looks, like a tall garden lilyPure from the night, and splendid for the day.
  Mother of the dews, dark eyelashed twilight,Lowlidded twilight, oer the valleys brim,Rounding on thy breast sings the dewdelighted skylark,Clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him.
Hidden where the roseflush drinks the rayless planet,Fountainfull he pours the spraying fountainshowers.
Let me hear her laughter, I would have her everCool as dew in twilight, the lark above the flowers.
  All the girls are out with their baskets for the primroseUp lanes, woods through, they troop in joyful bands.
My sweet leads she knows not why, but now she loiters,Eyes bent anemones, and hangs her hands.
Such a look will tell that the violets are peeping,Coming the rose and unaware a crySprings in her bosom for odours and for colour,Covert and the nightingale she knows not why.
  Kerchiefed head and chin, she darts between her tulips,Streaming like a willow grey in arrowy rainSome bend beaten cheek to gravel, and their angelShe will be she lifts them, and on she speeds again.
Black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gatewayShe is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth.
So when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder,Saw I once a white dove, sole light of earth.
  Prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden,Trained to stand in rows, and asking if they please.
I might love them well but for loving more the wild ones.
O my wild ones! they tell me more than these.
You, my wild one, you tell of honied fieldrose,Violet, blushing eglantine in life and even as they,They by the wayside are earnest of your goodness,You are of lifes, on the banks that line the way.
  Peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose,Jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three.
Parted is the window she sleeps the starry jasmineBreathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me.
Sweeter unpossessed, have I said of her my sweetestNot while she sleeps while she sleeps the jasmine breathes,Luring her to love she sleeps the starry jasmineBears me to her pillow under white rosewreaths.
  Yellow with birdfoottrefoil are the grassgladesYellow with cinquefoil of the dewgrey leafYellow with stonecrop the mossmounds are yellowBluenecked the wheat sways, yellowing to the sheaf.
Greenyellow, bursts from the copse the laughing yaffleSharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shineEarth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens,Thinking of the harvest I look and think of mine.
  This I may know her dressing and undressingSuch a change of light shows as when the skies in sportShift from cloud to moonlight or edging over thunderSlips a ray of sun or sweeping into portWhite sails furl or on the ocean bordersWhite sails lean along the waves leaping green.
Visions of her shower before me, but from eyesightGuarded she would be like the sun were she seen.
  Front door and back of the mossed old farmhouseOpen with the morn, and in a breezy linkFreshly sparkles garden to stripeshadowed orchard,Green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink.
Busy in the grass the early sun of summerSwarms, and the blackbirds mellow fluting notesCall my darling up with round and roguish challengeQuaintest, richest carol of all the singing throats!  Cool was the woodside cool as her white dairyKeeping sweet the creampan and there the boys from school,Cricketing below, rushed brown and red with sunshineO the dark translucence of the deepeyed cool!Spying from the farm, herself she fetched a pitcherFull of milk, and tilted for each in turn the beak.
Then a little fellow, mouth up and on tiptoe,Said, I will kiss you she laughed and leaned her cheek.
  Doves of the firwood walling high our red roofThrough the long noon coo, crooning through the coo.
Loose droop the leaves, and down the sleepy roadwaySometimes pipes a chaffinch loose droops the blue.
Cows flap a slow tail kneedeep in the river,Breathless, given up to sun and gnat and fly.
Nowhere is she seen and if I see her nowhere,Lightning may come, straight rains and tiger sky.
  O the golden sheaf, the rustling treasurearmful!O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced!O the treasuretresses one another overNodding! O the girdle slack about the waist!Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarletQuick amid the wheatears wound about the waist,Gathered, see these brides of earth one blush of ripeness!O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced!  Large and smoky red the suns cold disk drops,Clipped by naked hills, on violet shaded snowEastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise,Whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow.
Nightlong on black printbranches our beechtreeGazes in this whiteness nightlong could I.
Here may life on death or death on life be painted.
Let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die!  Gossips count her faults they scour a narrow chamberWhere there is no window, read not heaven or her.
When she was a tiny, one aged woman quavers,Plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear.
Faults she had once as she learnt to run and tumbledFaults of feature some see, beauty not complete.
Yet, good gossips, beauty that makes holyEarth and air, may have faults from head to feet.
  Hither she comes she comes to me she lingers,Deepens her brown eyebrows, while in new surpriseHigh rise the lashes in wonder of a strangerYet am I the light and living of her eyes.
Something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming,Nets her in her blushes, and wounds her, and tames.
 Sure of her haven, O like a dove alighting,Arms up, she dropped our souls were in our names.
  Soon will she lie like a whitefrost sunrise.
Yellow oats and brown wheat, barley pale as rye,Long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher,Felt the girdle loosened, seen the tresses fly.
Soon will she lie like a bloodred sunset.
Swift with the tomorrow, greenwinged Spring!Sing from the Southwest, bring her back the truants,Nightingale and swallow, song and dipping wing.
  Soft new beechleaves, up to beamy AprilSpreading bough on bough a primrose mountain, youLucid in the moon, raise lilies to the skyfields,Youngest green transfused in silver shining throughFairer than the lily, than the wild white cherryFair as in image my seraph love appearsBorne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelidsFair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears.
  Could I find a place to be alone with heaven,I would speak my heart out heaven is my need.
Every woodland tree is flushing like the dogwood,Flashing like the whitebeam, swaying like the reed.
Flushing like the dogwood crimson in OctoberStreaming like the flagreed Southwest blownFlashing as in gusts the suddenlighted whitebeamAll seem to know what is for heaven alone.
THE THREE SINGERS TO YOUNG BLOODCarols nature, counsel men.
Different notes as rook from wrenHear we when our steps begin,And the choice is cast within,Where a robber ravens taleUrges passions nightingale.
Hark to the three.
 Chimed they in one,Life were music of the sun.
Liquid first, and then the caw,Then the cry that knows not law.
IAs the birds do, so do we,Bill our mate, and choose our tree.
Swift to building work addressed,Any straw will help a nest.
Mates are warm, and this is truth,Glad the young that come of youth.
They have bloom i the blood and sapChilling at no thunderclap.
Man and woman on the thornTrust not Earth, and have her scorn.
They who in her lead confide,Wither me if they spread not wide!Look for aid to little things,You will get them quick as wings,Thick as feathers would you feed,Take the leap that springs the need.
IIContemplate the rutted roadLife is both a lure and goad.
Each to hold in measure just,Trample appetite to dust.
Mark the fool and wanton spinKeep to harness as a skin.
Ere you follow natures lead,Of her powers in you have heedElse a shiverer you will findYou have challenged humankind.
Mates are chosen marketwiseCoolest bargainer best buys.
Leap not, nor let leap the heartTrot your track, and drag your cart.
So your end may be in wool,Honoured, and with manger full.
IIIO the rosy light! it fleets,Dearer dying than all sweets.
That is life it waves and goesSolely in that cherished RosePalpitates, or else tis death.
Call it love with all thy breath.
Love! it lingers Love! it nearsLove! O Love! the Rose appears,Blushful, magic, reddening air.
Now the choice is on thee dare!Mortal seems the touch, but makesImmortal the hand that takes.
Feel what sea within thee shamesOf its force all other claims,Drowns them.
 Clasp! the world will beHeavenly Rose to swelling sea.
THE ORCHARD AND THE HEATHI chanced upon an early walk to spyA troop of children through an orchard gateThe boughs hung low, the grass was highThey had but to lift hands or waitFor fruits to fill them fruits were all their sky.
They shouted, running on from tree to tree,And played the game the wind plays, on and round.
Twas visible invisible gleePursuing and a fountains soundOf laughter spouted, pattering fresh on me.
I could have watched them till the daylight fled,Their pretty bower made such a light of day.
A small one tumbling sang, Oh! head!The rest to comfort her straightwaySeized on a branch and thumped down apples red.
The tiny creature flashing through green grass,And laughing with her feet and eyes amongFresh apples, while a little lassOver as oer breezeripples hungThat sight I saw, and passed as aliens pass.
My footpath left the pleasant farms and lanes,Soft cottagesmoke, straight cocks acrow, gay flowersBeyond the wheelruts of the wains,Across a heath I walked for hours,And met its rival tenants, rays and rains.
Still in my view miledistant firs appeared,When, under a patched channelbank enrichedWith foxglove whose late bells drooped seared,Behold, a family had pitchedTheir camp, and labouring the low tent upreared.
Here, too, were many children, quick to scanA new thing coming swarthy cheeks, white teethIn manycoloured rags they ran,Like iron runlets of the heath.
Dispersed lay brothpot, sticks, and drinkingcan.
Three girls, with shoulders like a boat at seaTipped sideways by the wave their clothing slidFrom either ridge unequally,Lean, swift and voluble, bestridA startingpoint, unfrocked to the bent knee.
They raced their brothers yelled them on, and brokeIn act to follow, but as one they snuffedWoodfumes, and by the fire that spokeOf provender, its pale flame puffed,And rolled athwart dwarf furzes greyblue smoke.
Soon on the dark edge of a ruddier gleam,The motherpot perusing, all, stretched flat,Paused for its bubblingup supremeA dog upright in circle sat,And oft his nose went with the flying steam.
I turned and looked on heaven awhile, where nowThe moorfaced sunset broadened with red lightThrew high aloft a golden bough,And seemed the desert of the nightFar down with mellow orchards to endow.
EARTH AND MANIOn her great venture, Man,Earth gazes while her fingers dint the breastWhich is his well of strength, his home of rest,And fair to scan.
IIMore aid than that embrace,That nourishment, she cannot give his heartInvolves his fate and she who urged the startAbides the race.
IIIFor he is in the listsContentious with the elements, whose dowerFirst sprang him for swift vultures to devourIf he desists.
IVHis breath of instant thirstIs warning of a creature matched with strife,To meet it as a bride, or let fall lifeOn lifes accursed.
VNo longer forth he boundsThe lusty animal, afield to roam,But peering in Earths entrails, where the gnomeStrange themes propounds.
VIBy hunger sharply spedTo grasp at weapons ere he learns their use,In each new ring he bears a giants thews,An infants head.
VIIAnd ever that old taskOf reading what he is and whence he came,Whither to go, finds wilder letters flameAcross her mask.
VIIIShe hears his wailful prayer,When now to the Invisible he ravesTo rend him from her, now of his mother cravesHer calm, her care.
IXThe thing that shudders mostWithin him is the burden of his cry.
Seen of his dread, she is to his blank eyeThe eyeless Ghost.
XOr sometimes she will seemHeavenly, but her blush, soon wearing white,Veils like a gorsebush in a web of blight,With goldbuds dim.
XIOnce worshipped Prime of Powers,She still was the Implacable as a beast,She struck him down and dragged him from the feastShe crowned with flowers.
XIIHer pomp of glorious hues,Her revelries of ripeness, her kind smile,Her songs, her peeping faces, lure awhileWith symbolclues.
XIIIThe mystery she holdsFor him, inveterately he strains to see,And sight of his obtuseness is the keyAmong those folds.
XIVHe may entreat, aspire,He may despair, and she has never heed.
She drinking his warm sweat will soothe his need,Not his desire.
XVShe prompts him to rejoice,Yet scares him on the threshold with the shroud.
He deems her cherishing of her bestendowedA wantons choice.
XVIAlbeit thereof he has foundFirm roadway between lustfulness and painHas half transferred the battle to his brain,From bloody groundXVIIHe will not read her good,Or wise, but with the passion Self obscuresThrough that old devil of the thousand lures,Through that dense hoodXVIIIThrough terror, through distrustThe greed to touch, to view, to have, to liveThrough all that makes of him a sensitiveAbhorring dust.
XIXBehold his wormy home!And he the windwhipped, anywhither waveCrazily tumbled on a shinglegraveTo waste in foam.
XXTherefore the wretch inclinedAfresh to the Invisible, who, he saith,Can raise him high with vows of living faithFor little signs.
XXISome signs he must demand,Some proofs of slaughtered nature some prized few,To satisfy the senses it is true,And in his hand,XXIIThis miracle which savesHimself, himself doth from extinction clutch,By virtue of his worth, contrasting muchWith brutes and knaves.
XXIIIFrom dust, of him abhorred,He would be snatched by Grace discovering worth.
Sever me from the hollowness of Earth!Me take, dear Lord!XXIVShe hears him.
 Him she owesFor half her loveliness a love well wonBy work that lights the shapeless and the dun,Their common foes.
XXVHe builds the soaring spires,That sing his soul in stone of her he draws,Though blind to her, by spelling at her laws,Her purest fires.
XXVIThrough him hath she exchanged,For the gold harvestrobes, the mural crown,Her haggard quarryfeatures and thick frownWhere monsters ranged.
XXVIIAnd order, high discourse,And decency, than which is life less dear,She has of him the lyre of language clear,Loves tongue and source.
XXVIIIShe hears him, and can hearWith glory in his gains by work achievedWith grief for grief that is the unperceivedIn her so near.
XXIXIf he aloft for aidImploring storms, her essence is the spur.
His cry to heaven is a cry to herHe would evade.
XXXNot elsewhere can he tend.
Those are her rules which bid him wash foul sinsThose her revulsions from the skull that grinsTo ape his end.
XXXIAnd her desires are thoseFor happiness, for lastingness, for light.
Tis she who kindles in his haunting nightThe hoped dawnrose.
XXXIIFair fountains of the darkDaily she waves him, that his inner dreamMay clasp amid the glooms a springing beam,A quivering larkXXIIIThis life and her to knowFor Spirit with awakenedness of gleeTo feel stern joy her origin not heThe child of woe.
XXXIVBut that the senses stillUsurp the station of their issue mind,He would have burst the chrysalis of the blindAs yet he willXXXVAs yet he will, she prays,Yet will when his distempered devil of Self The glutton for her fruits, the wily elfIn shifting rays XXXVIThat captain of the scornedThe coveter of life in soul and shell,The fratricide, the thief, the infidel,The hoofed and horned XXXVIIHe singularly doomedTo what he execrates and writhes to shun When fire has passed him vapour to the sun,And sun relumed,XXXVIIIThen shall the horrid pallBe lifted, and a spirit nigh divine,Live in thy offspring as I live in mine,Will hear her call.
XXXIXWhence looks he on a landWhereon his labour is a carven pageAnd forth from heritage to heritageNought writ on sand.
XLHis fables of the Above,And his gapped readings of the crown and sword,The hell detested and the heaven adored,The hate, the love,XLIThe bright wing, the black hoof,He shall peruse, from Reason not disjoined,And never unfaith clamouring to be coinedTo faith by proof.
XLIIShe her just Lord may view,Not he, her creature, till his soul has yearnedWith all her gifts to reach the light discernedHer spirit through.
XLIIIIThen in him time shall runAs in the hour that to young sunlight crowsAndIf thou hast good faith it can repose,She tells her son.
XLIVMeanwhile on him, her chiefExpression, her great word of life, looks sheTwiminded of him, as the waxing tree,Or dated leaf.
A BALLAD OF FAIR LADIES IN REVOLTISee the sweet women, friend, that lean beneathThe everfalling fountain of green leavesRound the white bending stem, and like a wreathOf our most blushful flower shine trembling through,To teach philosophers the thirst of thievesIs one for me is one for youII Fair sirs, we give you welcome, yield you place,And you shall choose among us which you will,Without the idle pastime of the chase,If to this treaty you can well agreeTo wed our cause, and its high task fulfil.
He whos for us, for him are we!III Most gracious ladies, nigh when light has birth,A troop of maids, brown as burnt heatherbells,And rich with life as mossroots breathe of earthIn the first plucking of them, past us flewTo labour, singing rustic ritornellsHad they a cause are they of youIV Sirs, they are as unthinking armies areTo thoughtful leaders, and our cause is theirs.
When they know men they know the state of warBut now they dream like sunlight on a sea,And deem you hold the half of happy pairs.
He whos for us, for him are we!V Ladies, I listened to a ring of damesJudicial in the robe and wig secureAs venerated portraits in their framesAnd they denounced some insurrection newAgainst sound laws which keep you good and pure.
Are you of them are they of youVI Sirs, they are of us, as their dress denotes,And by as much let them together chimeIt is an ancient bell within their throats,Pulled by an aged ringer with what gleeBefits the yellow yesterdays of time.
He whos for us, for him are we!VII Sweet ladies, you with beauty, you with witDowered of all favours and all blessed thingsWhereat the ruddy torch of Love is litWherefore this vain and outworn strife renew,Which stays the tide no more than eddyringsWho is for love must be for you.
VIII The manners of the market, honest sirs,Tis hard to quit when you behold the wares.
You flatter us, or perchance our millinersYou flatter so this vain and outworn SheMay still be the charmed snake to your soft airs!A higher lord than Love claim we.
IX One day, dear lady, missing the broad track,I came on a woods border, by a mead,Where golden May ran up to moted blackAnd there I saw Queen Beauty hold review,With Love before her throne in act to plead.
Take him for me, take her for you.
X Ingenious gentleman, the tale is known.
Love pleaded sweetly Beauty would not meltShe would not melt he turned in wrath her throneThe shadow of his back froze witheringly,And sobbing at his feet Queen Beauty knelt.
O not such slaves of Love are we!XI Love, lady, like the star above that lanceOf radiance flung by sunset on ridged cloud,Sad as the last line of a brave romance! Young Love hung dim, yet quivering round him threwBeams of fresh fire, while Beauty waned and bowed.
Scorn Love, and dread the doom for you.
XII Called she not for her mirror, sir Forth ranHer women I am lost, she cried, when lo,Love in the form of an admiring manOnce more in adoration bent the knee,And brought the faded Pagan to full blowFor which her throne she gave not we!XIII My version, madam, runs not to that end.
A certain madness of an hour half past,Caught her like fever her just lord no friendShe fancied aimed beyond beauty, and thence grewThe prim acerbity, sweet Loves outcast.
Great heaven ward off that stroke from you!XIV Your prayer to heaven, good sir, is generousHow generous likewise that you do not nameOffended nature! She from all of usCouched idle underneath our showering tree,May quite withhold her most destructive flameAnd then what woeful women we!XV Quite, could not be, fair lady yet your youthMay run to drought in visionary schemesAnd a late waking to perceive the truth,When day falls shrouding her supreme adieu,Shows darker wastes than unaccomplished dreamsAnd that may be in store for you.
XVI O sir, the truth, the truth! ist in the skies,Or in the grass, or in this heart of oursBut O the truth, the truth! the many eyesThat look on it! the diverse things they see,According to their thirst for fruit or flowers!Pass on it is the truth seek we.
XVII Lady, there is a truth of settled lawsThat down the past burns like a great watchfire.
Let youth hail changeful mornings but your cause,Whetting its edge to cut the race in two,Is felony you forfeit the bright lyre,Much honour and much glory you!XVIII Sir, was it glory, was it honour, pride,And not as cat and serpent and poor slave,Wherewith we walked in union by your sideSpare to false womanliness her delicacy,Or bid true manliness give ear, we craveIn our defence thus chained are we.
XIX Yours, madam, were the privileges of lifeProper to mans ideal you were the markOf action, and the banner in the strifeYea, of your very weakness once you drewThe strength that sounds the wells, outflies the larkWrapped in a robe of flame were you!XX Your friend looks thoughtful.
 Sir, when we were chill,You clothed us warmly all in honour! whenWe starved you fed us all in honour stillOh, all in honour, ultrahonourably!Deep is the gratitude we owe to men,For privileged indeed were we!XXI You cite exceptions, madam, that are sad,But come in the red struggle of our growth.
Alas, that I should have to say it! badIs twosexed upon earth this which you do,Shows animal impatience, mental slothMan monstrous! pining seraphs you!XXII I fain would ask your friend .
 .
 .
 but I will askYou, sir, how if in place of numbers vague,Your sad exceptions were to break that maskThey wear for your cool mind historically,And blaze like black lists of a PRESENT plagueBut in that light behold them we.
XXIII Your spirit breathes a mist upon our world,Lady, and like a rain to pierce the roofAnd drench the bed where toiltossed man lies curledIn his hardearned oblivion! You are few,Scattered, illcounselled, blinded for a proof,I have lived, and have known none like you.
XXIV We may be blind to men, sir we embraceA future now beyond the fowlers nets.
Though few, we hold a promise for the raceThat was not at our rising you are freeTo win brave mates you lose but marionnettes.
He whos for us, for him are we.
XXV Ah! madam, were they puppets who withstoodYouths cravings for adventure to preserveThe dedicated ways of womanhoodThe light which leads us from the paths of rue,That light above us, never seen to swerve,Should be the homelamp trimmed by you.
XXVI Ah! sir, our worshipped posture we perchanceShall not abandon, though we see not how,Being to that lamppost fixed, we may advanceBeside our lords in any real degree,Unless we move and to advance is nowA sovereign need, think more than we.
XXVII So push you out of harbour in small craft,With little seamanship and comes a gale,The world will laugh, the world has often laughed,Lady, to see how bold when skies are blue,When black winds churn the deeps how panicpale,How swift to the old nest fly you!XXVIII What thinks your friend, kind sir We have escapedBut partly that old halftamed wild beasts pawWhereunder woman, the weak thing, was shapedMen, too, have known the cramping enemyIn grim brute force, whom force of brain shall aweHim our deliverer, await we!XXIX Delusions are with eloquence endowed,And yours might pluck an angel from the spheresTo play in this revolt whereto you are vowed,Deliverer, lady! but like summer dewOer fields that crack for rain your friends drop tears,Who see the awakening for you.
XXX Is he our friend, there silent he weeps not.
O sir, delusion mounting like a sunOn a mind blank as the white wife of Lot,Giving it warmth and movement! if this beDelusion, think of what thereby was wonFor men, and dream of what win we.
XXXI Lady, the destiny of minor powers,Who would recast us, is but to convulseYou enter on a strife that frets and soursYou can but win sick disappointments hueAnd simply an accelerated pulse,Some tonic you have drunk moves you.
XXXII Thinks your friend so Good sir, your wit is brightBut wit that strives to speak the popular voice,Puts on its nightcap and puts out its light.
Curfew, would seem your conquerors decreeTo women likewise and we have no choiceSave darkness or rebellion, we!XXXIII A plain safe intermediate way is cleftBy reason foiling passion you that raveOf mad alternatives to right and leftEcho the tempter, madam and tis dueUnto your sex to shun it as the grave,This later apple offered you.
XXXIV This apple is not ripe, it is not sweetNor rosy, sir, nor golden eye and mouthAre little wooed by it yet we would eat.
We are somewhat tired of Eden, is our plea.
We have thirsted long this apple suits our drouthTis good for men to halve, think we.
XXXV But say, what seek you, madam Tis enoughThat you should have dominion oer the springsDomestic and mans heart those ways, how rough,How vile, outside the stately avenueWhere you walk sheltered by your angels wings,Are happily unknown to you.
XXXVI We hear womens shrieks on them.
 We like your phrase,Dominion domestic! And that roar,What seek you is of tyrants in all days.
Sir, get you something of our purityAnd we will of your strength we ask no more.
That is the sum of what seek we.
XXXVII O for an image, madam, in one word,To show you as the lightning night reveals,Your error and your perils you have erredIn mind only, and the perils that ensueSwift heels may soften wherefore to swift heelsAddress your hopes of safety you!XXXVIII To err in mind, sir .
 .
 .
 your friend smiles he may!To err in mind, if err in mind we can,Is grievous error you do well to stay.
But O how different from realityMens fiction is! how like you in the plan,Is woman, knew you her as we!XXXIX Look, lady, where yon river winds its lineToward sunset, and receives on breast and faceThe splendour of fair life to be divine,Tis nature bids you be to nature true,Flowing with beauty, lending earth your grace,Reflecting heaven in clearness you.
XL Sir, you speak well your friend no word vouchsafes.
To flow with beauty, breeding fools and worse,Cowards and worse at such fair life she chafes,Who is not wholly of the nursery,Nor of your schools we share the primal curseTogether shake it off, say we!XLI Hear, then, my friend, madam! Tonguerestrained he standsTill words are thoughts, and thoughts, like swords enrichedWith traceries of the artificers hands,Are fireproved steel to cut, fair flowers to view.
 Do I hear him Oh, he is bewitched, bewitched!Heed him not! Traitress beauties you!XLII We have won a champion, sisters, and a sage! Ladies, you win a guest to a good feast! Sir spokesman, sneers are weakness veiling rage.
 Of weakness, and wise men, you have the key.
 Then are there fresher mornings mounting EastThan ever yet have dawned, sing we!XLIII False ends as false began, madam, be sure! What lure there is the pure cause purifies! Who purifies the victim of the lure That soul which bids us our high light pursue.
 Some heights are measured down the wary wiseShun Reason in the masque with you!XLIV Sir, for the friend you bring us, take our thanks.
Yes, Beauty was of old this barren goalA thing with claws and brutelike in her pranks!But could she give more loyal guaranteeThan wooing Wisdom, that in her a soulHas risen Adieu content are we!XLVThose ladies led their captive to the floodsGreen edge.
 He floating with them seemed the mostFoolflushed old noddy ever crowned with buds.
Happier than I! Then, why not wiser tooFor he that lives with Beauty, he may boastHis comrade over me and you.
XLVIHave women nursed some dream since Helen sailedOver the sea of blood the blushing star,That beauty, whom frail man as Goddess hailed,When not possessing her for such is he!,Might in a wondering season seen afar,Be tamed to say not I, but weXLVIIAnd shall they make of Beauty their estate,The fortress and the weapon of their sexShall she in her frostbrilliancy dictate,More queenly than of old, how we must woo,Ere she will melt The halters on our necks,Kick as it likes us, I and you.
XLVIIICertain it is, if Beauty has disdainedHer ancient conquests, with an aim thus highIf this, if that, if more, the fight is gained.
But can she keep her followers without feeYet ah! to hear anew those ladies cry,He whos for us, for him are we!THE TWO MASKSMelpomene among her livid people,Ere stroke of lyre, upon Thaleia looks,Warned by old contests that one museful rippleAlong those lips of rose with tendril hooksForebodes disturbance in the springs of pathos,Perchance may change of masks midway demand,Albeit the man rise mountainous as Athos,The woman wild as Cape Leucadia stand.
IIFor this the Comic Muse exacts of creaturesAppealing to the fount of tears that theyStrive never to outleap our human features,And do Right Reasons ordinance obey,In peril of the hum to laughter nighest.
But prove they under stress of actions fireNobleness, to that test of Reason highest,She bows she waves them for the loftier lyre.
ARCHDUCHESS ANNEIIn middle age an evil thingBefell Archduchess AnneShe looked outside her weddingringUpon a princely man.
IICount Louis was for horse and armsAnd if its beacon waved,For love but ladies had not charmsTo match a danger braved.
IIIOn battlefields he was the bowBestrung to fly the shaftIn idle hours his heart would flowAs winds on currents waft.
IVHis blood was of those warrior tribesThat streamed from mornings fire,Whom now with traps and now with bribesThe wily Council wire.
VArchduchess Anne the Council ruled,Count Louis his great dameAnd woe to both when one had cooled!Little was she to blame.
VIAmong her chiefs who spun their plots,Old Kraken stood the swordAs sharp his wits for cutting knotsOf babble he abhorred.
VIIHe reverenced her name and line,Nor other merit hadSave soldierwise to wait her sign,And do the deed she bade.
VIIIHe saw her hand jump at her sideEre royally she smiledOn Louis and his fair young brideWhere courtly ranks defiled.
IXThat was a moment when a shockThrough the procession ran,And thrilled the plumes, and stayed the clock,Yet smiled Archduchess Anne.
XNo touch gave she to hound in leash,No wink to sword in sheathShe seemed a woman scarce of fleshAbove it, or beneath.
XIOld Kraken spied with kennelled snarl,His Lady deemed disgraced.
He footed as on burning marl,When out of Hall he paced.
XIITwas seen he hammered striding legs,And stopped, and strode again.
Now Vengeance has a brood of eggs,But Patience must be hen.
XIIIToo slow are they for wrath to hatch,Too hot for time to rear.
Old Kraken kept unwinding watchHe marked his day appear.
XIVHe neighed a laugh, though moods were roughWith standards in revoltHis nostrils took the news for snuff,His smacking lips for salt.
XVCount Louis wavy cocks plumes ledHis troops of blackhaired manes,A rebel and old Kraken spedTo front him on the plains.
XVIThen camp opposed to camp did theyFret earth with panther clawsFor signal of a bloody day,Each reading from the Laws.
XVIIForefend it, heaven! Count Louis cried,And let the righteous pleadMy country is a willing bride,Was never slave decreed.
XVIIINot we for thirst of blood appealTo sword and slaughter curstWe have Gods blessing on our steel,Do we our pleading first.
XIXCount Louis, soul of chivalry,Put trust in plighted wordBy starlight on the broad brown lea,To bar the strife he spurred.
XXAcross his breast a crimson spot,That in a quiver glowed,The ruddy crested campfires shot,As he to darkness rode.
XXIHe rode while omens called, bewareOld Krakens pledge of faith!A smile and waving hand in air,And outward flew the wraith.
XXIIBefore pale morn had mixed with gold,His army roared, and chilled,As men who have a woe foretold,And see it red fulfilled.
XXIIIAway and to his young wife speed,And say that Honours dead!Another word she will not needTo bow a widows head.
XXIVOld Kraken roped his white moustacheRight, left, for savage glee To swing him in his soldiers sashWere kind for such as he!XXVOld Krakens look hard Winter wearsWhen sweeps the wild snowblastHe had the hug of Arctic bearsFor captives he held fast.
IArchduchess Anne sat carved in frost,Shut off from priest and spouse.
Her lips were locked, her arms were crossed,Her eyes were in her brows.
IIOne hand enclosed a paper scroll,Held as a strangled asp.
So may we see the womans soulIn her dire tempters grasp.
IIIAlong that scroll Count Louis doomThrobbed till the letters flamed.
She saw him in his scornful bloom,She saw him chained and shamed.
IVAround that scroll Count Louis fateWas acted to her stare,And hate in love and love in hateFought fell to smite or spare.
VBetween the day that struck her old,And this black star of days,Her heart swung like a stormbell tolledAbove a town ablaze.
VIHis beauty pressed to intercede,His beauty served him ill.
 Not Vengeance, tis his rebels deed,Tis Justice, not our will!VIIYet who had sprung to lifes full forceA breast that loveless driedBut who had sapped it at the source,With scarlet to her pride!VIIIHe brought her waning heart as twereNew message from the skies.
And he betrayed, and left on herThe burden of their sighs.
IXIn floods her tender memories pouredThey foamed with waves of spiteShe crushed them, high her heart outsoared,To keep her mind alight.
X The crawling creature, called in scornA woman!with this penWe sign a paper that may warnHis crowing fellowmen.
XI We read them lesson of a powerThey slight who do us wrong.
That bitter hour this bitter hourProvokes by turns the strong!XII That we were woman once is knownThat we are Justice now,Above our sex, above the throne,Men quaking shall avow.
XIIIArchduchess Anne ascending flew,Her heart outsoared, but feltThe demon of her sex pursue,Incensing or to melt.
XIVThose counterfloods below at leapStill in her breast blew storm,And farther up the heavenly steepWrestled in angels form.
XVTo disentangle one clear wishNot of her sex, she soughtAnd womanish to womanishDiscerned in lighted thought.
XVIWith Louis chance it went not wellWhen at herself she ragedA woman, of whom men might tellShe doted, crazed and aged.
XVIIOr else enamoured of a sweetWithdrawn, a vengeful crone!And say, what figure at her feetIs this that utters moanXVIIIThe Countess Louis from her headDrew veil Great Lady, hear!My husband deems you Justice dread,I know you Mercy dear.
XIXHis error upon him may fallHe will not breathe a nay.
I am his helpless mate in all,Except for grace to pray.
XXPerchance on me his choice inclined,To give his House an heirI had not marriage with his mind,His counsel could not share.
XXII brought no portion for his wealBut this one instinct true,Which bids me in my weakness kneel,Archduchess Anne, to you.
XXIIThe frowning Lady uttered, Forth!Her look forbade delayIt is not mine to weigh your worthYour husbands others weigh.
XXIIIHence with the woman in your speech,For nothing it availsIn womans fashion to beseechWhere Justice holds the scales.
XXIVThen bent and went the lady wan,Whose girlishness made greyThe thoughts that through Archduchess AnneShattered like stormy spray.
XXVLong sat she there, as flame that strivesTo hold on beating wind His wife must be the fool of wives,Or cunningly designed!XXVIShe sat until the tempestpitchIn her torn bosom fell His wife must be a subtle witchOr else God loves her well!IOld Kraken read a missive pennedBy his great Ladys hand.
Her condescension called him friend,To raise the crest she fanned.
IISwiftly to where he lay encampedIt flew, yet breathed aloofFrom womans feeling, and he stampedA heel more like a hoof.
IIIShe wrote of Mercy She was lothToo hard to goad a foe.
He stamped, as when men drive an oathDevils transcribe below.
IVShe wrote We have him half by theft.
His wrinkles glistened keenAnd see the Winter stormcloud cleftTo lurid skies between!VWhen read old Kraken Christ our Guide,His eyes were spikes of sparAnd see the white snowstorm divideAbout an icy star!VIShe trusted him to understand,She wrote, and further prayedThat policy might rule the land.
Old Krakens laughter neighed.
VIIHer words he took her nods and winksTreated as womans fog.
The mandog for his mistress thinks,Not less her faithful dog.
VIIIShe hugged a cloak old Kraken rippedDisguise to him he loathed.
 Your mercy, madam, shows you stripped,While mine will keep you clothed.
IXA rough illsoldered scar in hasteHe rubbed on his cheekbone.
 Our policy the man shall tasteOur mercy shall be shown.
XCount Louis, honour to your raceDecrees the CouncilhallYou scape the rope by special grace,And like a soldier fall.
XI I am a man of many sins,Who for one virtue die,Count Louis said.
They play at shins,Who kick, was the reply.
XIIUprose the day of crimson sight,The day without a God.
At morn the hero said GoodnightSee there that stain on sod!XIIIAt morn the Countess Louis heardYoung light sing in the lark.
Ere eve it was that other bird,Which brings the starless dark.
XIVTo heaven she vowed herself, and yearnedBeside her lord to lie.
Archduchess Anne on Kraken turned,All white as a dead eye.
XVIf I could kill thee! shrieked her lookIf lightning sprang from Will!An oaken head old Kraken shook,And she might thank or kill.
XVIThe pride that fenced her heart in mailBy mortal pain was torn.
Forth from her bosom leaped a wail,As of a babe newborn.
XVIIShe clad herself in courtly use,And one who heard them prateHad said they differed upon viewsWhere statecraft raised debate.
XVIIIThe wretch detested must she trust,The servant master ownConfide to godless cause so just,And for Gods blessing moan.
XIXAusterely she her heart kept down,Her womans tongue was muteWhen voice of People, voice of Crown,In cannon held dispute.
XXThe Crown on seas of blood, like swine,Swam forefoot at the throatIt drank of its dear veins for wine,Enough if it might float!XXIIt sank with piteous yelp, resurgedElectrical with fear.
O had she on old Kraken urgedHer word of mercy clear!XXIIO had they with Count Louis beenAccordant in his plea!Cursed are the women vowed to screenA heart that all can see!XXIIIThe godless drove unto a goalWas worse than vile defeat.
Did vengeance prick Count Louis soulThey dressed him luscious meat.
XXIVWorms will the faithless find their liesIn the close treasurechest.
Without a God no day can rise,Though it should slay our best.
XXVThe Crown it furled a draggled flag,It sheathed a broken blade.
Behold its triumph in the hagThat lives with looks decayed!XXVIAnd lo, the man of oaken head,Of soldiers honour bare,He fled his land, but most he fledHis Ladys frigid stare.
XXVIIJudged by the issue we discernGods blessing, and the bane.
Count Louis dust would fill an urn,His deeds are waving grain.
XXVIIIAnd she that helped to slay, yet badeTo spare the fated man,Great were her errors, but she hadGreat heart, Archduchess Anne.

THE YOUNG PRINCESSA BALLAD OF OLD LAWS OF LOVEIWhen the South sang like a nightingaleAbove a bower in May,The training of Loves vine of flameWas writ in laws, for lord and dameTo say their yea and nay.
IIWhen the South sang like a nightingaleAcross the flowering night,And lord and dame held gentle sport,There came a young princess to Court,A frost of beauty white.
IIIThe South sang like a nightingaleTo thaw her glittering dreamNo vine of Love her bosom gave,She drank no wine of Love, but graveShe held them to Loves theme.
IVThe South grew all a nightingaleBeneath a moon unmovedLike the banner of war she led them onShe left them to lie, like the light that has goneFrom winecups overproved.
VWhen the South was a fervid nightingale,And she a chilling moon,Twas pity to see on the garden swards,Against Loves laws, those rival lordsAs willowwands lie strewn.
VIThe South had throat of a nightingaleFor her, the young princessShe gave no vine of Love to rear,Loves wine drank not, yet bent her earTo themes of Love no less.
IThe lords of the Court they sighed heartsick,Heartfree Lord Dusiote laughedI prize her no more than a fling o the dice,But, or shame to my manhood, a lady of ice,We master her by craft!IIHeartsick the lords of joyance yawned,Lord Dusiote laughed heartfreeI count her as much as a crack o my thumb,But, or shame of my manhood, to me she shall comeLike the bird to roost in the tree!IIIAt dead of night when the palaceguardHad passed the measured rounds,The young princess awoke to feelA shudder of blood at the crackle of steelWithin the gardenbounds.
IVIt ceased, and she thought of whom was need,The friar or the leechWhen lo, stood her tirewoman breathless byLord Dusiote, madam, to death is nigh,Of you he would have speech.
VHe prays you of your gentleness,To light him to his dark end.
The princess rose, and forth she went,For charity was her intent,Devoutly to befriend.
VILord Dusiote hung on his good squires arm,The priest beside him kneltA weeping handkerchief was pressedTo stay the red flood at his breast,And bid cold ladies melt.
VIIO lady, though you are ice to men,All pure to heaven as lightWithin the dew within the flower,Of you tis whispered that love has powerWhen secret is the night.
VIIII have silenced the slanderers, peace to their souls!Save one was too cunning for me.
I die, whose love is late avowed,He lives, who boasts the lily has bowedTo the oath of a bended knee.
IXLord Dusiote drew breath with pain,And she with pain drew breathOn him she looked, on his like aboveShe flew in the folds of a marvel of loveRevealed to pass to death.
XYou are dying, O greathearted lord,You are dying for me, she criedO take my hand, O take my kiss,And take of your right for love like this,The vow that plights me bride.
XIShe bade the priest recite his wordsWhile hand in hand were they,Lord Dusiotes soul to waft to blissHe had her hand, her vow, her kiss,And his body was borne away.
ILord Dusiote sprang from priest and squireHe gazed at her lighted roomThe laughter in his heart grew slackHe knew not the force that pushed him backFrom her and the morn in bloom.
IILike a drowned mans length on the strong floodtide,Like the shade of a bird in the sun,He fled from his lady whom he might claimAs ghost, and who made the daybeams flameTo scare what he had done.
IIIThere was grief at Court for one so gay,Though he was a lord less keenFor training the vine than at vintagepressBut in her soul the young princessBelieved that love had been.
IVLord Dusiote fled the Court and land,He crossed the woeful seas,Till his traitorous doing seemed clearer to burn,And the lady beloved drew his heart for return,Like the banner of war in the breeze.
VHe neared the palace, he spied the Court,And music he heard, and they toldOf foreign lords arrived to bringThe nuptial gifts of a bridegroom kingTo the princess grave and cold.
VIThe masque and the dance were cloud on wave,And down the masque and the danceLord Dusiote stepped from dame to dame,And to the young princess he came,With a bow and a burning glance.
VIIDo you take a new husband tomorrow, ladyShe shrank as at prick of steel.
Must the first yield place to the second, he sighed.
Her eyes were like the grave that is wideFor the corpse from head to heel.
VIIIMy lady, my love, that little handHas mine ringed fast in plightI bear for your lips a lawful thirst,And as justly the second should follow the first,I come to your door this night.
IXIf a ghost should come a ghost will goNo more the lady said,Save that ever when he in wrath beganTo swear by the faith of a living man,She answered him, You are dead.
IThe soft nightwind went laden to deathWith smell of the orange in flowerThe light leaves prattled to neighbour earsThe bird of the passion sang over his tearsThe night named hour by hour.
IISang loud, sang low the rapturous birdTill the yellow hour was nigh,Behind the folds of a darker cloudHe chuckled, he sobbed, alow, aloudThe voice between earth and sky.
IIIO will you, will you, women are weakThe proudest are yielding matesFor a forward foot and a tongue of fireSo thought Lord Dusiotes trusty squire,At watch by the palacegates.
IVThe song of the bird was wine in his blood,And woman the odorous bloomHis masters great adventure stirredWithin him to mingle the bloom and bird,And morn ere its coming illume.
VBeside him strangely a piece of the darkHad moved, and the undertonesOf a priest in prayer, like a cavernous wave,He heard, as were there a soul to saveFor urgency now in the groans.
VINo priest was hired for the play this nightAnd the squire tossed head like a deerAt sniff of the tainted wind he gazedWhere cressetlamps in a door were raised,Belike on a passing bier.
VIIAll cloaked and masked, with naked blades,That flashed of a judgement done,The lords of the Court, from the palacedoor,Came issuing silently, bearers four,And flat on their shoulders one.
VIIIThey marched the body to squire and priest,They lowered it sad to earthThe priest they gave the burial dole,Bade wrestle hourly for his soul,Who was a lord of worth.
IXOne said, farewell to a gallant knight!And one, but a restless ghost!Tis a year and a day since in this placeHe died, sped high by a lady of graceTo join the blissful host.

MANFREDIProjected from the bilious Childe,This clatterjaw his foot could setOn Alps, without a breast beguiledTo glow in shedding rascal sweat.
Somewhere about his grinder teeth,He mouthed of thoughts that grilled beneath,And summoned Nature to her feudWith bile and buskin Attitude.
IIConsiderably was the worldOf spinsterdom and clergy rackedWhile he his hinted horrors hurled,And she pictorially attacked.
A duel hugeous.
 Tragic Ho!The cities, not the mountains, blowSuch bladders in their shapes confessedAn afterdinners indigest.
HERNANICistercians might crack their sidesWith laughter, and exemption get,At sight of heroes clasping brides,And hearingO the horn! the horn!The horn of their obstructive debt!But quit the stage, that note appliesFor sermons cosmopolitan,Hernani.

 O the horn! the horn!The horn of the Old Gentleman!THE NUPTIALS OF ATTILAIFlat as to an eagles eye,Earth hung under Attila.
Sign for carnage gave he none.
In the peace of his disdain,Sun and rain, and rain and sun,Cherished men to wax again,Crawl, and in their manner die.
On his people stood a frost.
Like the charger cut in stone,Rearing stiff, the warrior host,Which had life from him alone,Craved the trumpets eager note,As the bridled earth the Spring.
Rusty was the trumpets throat.
He let chief and prophet raveVenturous earth around him stringThreads of grass and slender rye,Wave them, and untrampled wave.
O for the time when God did cry,Eye and have, my Attila!IIScorn of conquest filled like sleepHim that drank of havoc deepWhen the Green Cat pawed the globeWhen the horsemen from his bowShot in sheaves and made the foeCrimson fringes of a robe,Trailed oer towns and fields in woeWhen they streaked the rivers red,When the saddle was the bed.
Attila, my Attila!IIIHe breathed peace and pulled a flower.
Eye and have, my Attila!This was the damsel Ildico,Rich in bloom until that hourShyer than the forest doeTwinkling slim through branches green.
Yet the shyest shall be seen.
Make the bed for Attila!IVSeen of Attila, desired,She was led to him straightwayRadiantly was she attiredRifled lands were her array,Jewels bled from weeping crowns,Gold of woeful fields and towns.
She stood pallid in the light.
How she walked, how withered white,From the blessing to the board,She who would have proudly blushed,Women whispered, asking why,Hinting of a youth, and hushed.
Was it terror of her lordWas she childish was she slyWas it the bright mantles dyeDrained her blood to hues of griefLike the ash that shoots the sparkSee the green tree all in leafSee the green tree stripped of bark! Make the bed for Attila!VRound the banquettables loadScores of iron horsemen rodeChosen warriors, keen and hardGrain of threshing battledintsAttilas fierce bodyguard,Smelling war like fire in flints.

Beaming with the goblet wineIn the wavering of the torch,Looked he backward on his bride.
Eye and have, my Attila!Fair in her wide robe was sheWhere the robe and vest divide,Fair she seemed surpassinglySoft, yet vivid as the streamDanube rolls in the moonbeamThrough rockbarriers but she smiledNever, she sat cold as saltOpenmouthed as a young childWondering with a mind at fault.
Make the bed for Attila!VIIUnder the thin hoop of goldWhence in waves her hair outrolled,Twixt her brows the women sawShadows of a vultures clawGript in flight strange knots that spedClosing and dissolving ayeSuch as wicked dreams betrayWhen pale dawn creeps oer the bed.
They might show the common pangKnown to virgins, in whom dreadHunts their bliss like famished houndsWhile the chiefs with roaring roundsTossed her to her lord, and sangPraise of him whose hand was large,Cheers for beauty brought to yield,Chirrups of the trot afield,Hurrahs of the battlecharge.
VIIIThose rockfaces hung with weedReddened their great days of speed,Slaughter, triumph, flood and flame,Like a jealous frenzy wrought,Scoffed at them and did them shame,Quaffing idle, conquering nought.
O for the time when God decreedEarth the prey of Attila!God called on thee in his wrath,Trample it to mire! Twas done.
Swift as Danube clove our pathDown from East to Western sun.
Huns! behold your pasture, gaze,Take, our king said heel to flankWhisper it, the warhorse neighs!Forth we drove, and blood we drankFresh as dawndew earth was oursMen were flocks we lashed and spurnedFast as windy flame devours,Flame along the wind, we burned.
Arrow javelin, spear, and sword!Here the snows and there the plainsOn! our signal onward pouredTorrents of the tightened reins,Foaming over vine and cornHot against the citywall.
Whisper it, you sound a hornTo the grey beast in the stall!Yea, he whinnies at a nod.
O for sound of the trumpetnotes!O for the time when thundershod,He that scarce can munch his oats,Hung on the peaks, brooded aloof,Champed the grain of the wrath of God,Pressed a cloud on the cowering roof,Snorted out of the blackness fire!Scarlet broke the sky, and down,Hammering West with print of his hoof,He burst out of the bosom of ireSharp as eyelight under thy frown,Attila, my Attila!IXRavaged cities rolling smokeThick on cornfields dry and black,Wave his banners, bear his yoke.
Track the lightning, and you trackAttila.
 They moan tis he!Bleed tis he! Beneath his footLeagues are deserts charred and muteWhere he passed, there passed a sea.

Feast, ye Huns! His arm be raised,Like the warrior, battledazed,Joining to the fight amain.
Make the bed for Attila!XISilent Ildico stood up.
King and chief to pledge her well,Shocked sword sword and cup on cup,Clamouring like a brazen bell.
Silent stepped the queenly slave.
Fair, by heaven! she was to meetOn a midnight, near a grave,Flapping wide the windingsheet.
XIIDeath and she walked through the crowd,Out beyond the flush of light.
Ceremonious women bowedFollowing her twas middle night.
Then the warriors each on eachSpied, nor overloudly laughedLike the victims of the leech,Who have drunk of a strange draught.
XIIIAttila remained.
 Even soFrowned he when he struck the blow,Brained his horse, that stumbled twice,On a bloody day in Gaul,Bellowing, Perish omens! AllMarvelled at the sacrifice,But the battle, swinging dim,Rang off that axeblow for him.
Attila, my Attila!XIVBrightening over Danube wheeledStar by star and she, most fair,Sweet as victory halfrevealed,Seized to make him glad and youngShe, O sweet as the dark signGiven him oft in battles gone,When the voice within said, Dare!And the trumpetnotes were sprungRapturous for the charge in lineShe lay waiting fair as dawnWrapped in folds of night she laySecret, lustrous flaglike there,Waiting him to stream and ray,With one loosening blush outflung,Colours of his hordes of horseRanked for combat still he hungLike the fever dreading air,Cursed of heat and as a corseGathers vultures, in his brainImages of her eyes and kissPlucked at the limbs that could remainLoitering nigh the doors of bliss.
Make the bed for Attila!XVPassion on one hand, on one,Destiny led forth the Hun.
Heard ye outcries of affright,Voices that through many a fray,In the press of flag and spear,Warned the king of peril nearMen were dumb, they gave him way,Eager heads to left and right,Like the bearded standard, thrust,As in battle, for a nodFrom their lord of battledust.
Attila, my Attila!Slow between the lines he trod.
Saw ye not the sun drop slowOn this nuptial day, ere evePierced him on the couch aglowAttila, my Attila!Here and there his heart would cleaveClotted memory for a spaceSome stout chiefs familiar face,Choicest of his fighting brood,Touched him, as twere one to knowEre he met his brides embrace.
Attila, my Attila!Twisting fingers in a beardScant as winter underwood,With a narrowed eye he peeredLike the sunsets graver redUp old pinestems.
 Grave he stoodEyeing them on whom was shedBurning light from him alone.
Attila, my Attila!Red were they whose mouths recalledWhere the slaughter mounted high,High on it, oer earth appalled,He heavens finger in their sightRaising him on waves of dead,Up to heaven his trumpets blown.
O for the time when Gods delightCrowned the head of Attila!Hungry river of the cragStretching hands for earth he cameForce and Speed astride his namePointed back to spear and flag.
He came out of miracle cloud,Lightningswift and spectrelean.
Now those days are in a shroudHave him to his ghostly queen.
Make the bed for Attila!XVIOne, with winecups overstrung,Cried him farewell in Romes tongue.
Who for the great king turned as thoughWrath to the shafts head strained the bow.
Nay, not wrath the king possessed,But a radiance of the breast.
In that sound he had the keyOf his cunning malady.
Lo, where gleamed the sapphire lake,Leo, with his Rome at stake,Drew blank air to hues and formsWhereof Two that shone distinct,Linked as orbed stars are linked,Clear among the myriad swarms,In a constellation, dashedFull on horse and riders eyesSunless light, but light it was Light that blinded and abashed,Froze his members, bade him pause,Caught him midgallop, blazed him home.
Attila, my Attila!What are streams that cease to flowWhat was Attila, rolled thence,Cheated by a jugglers showLike that lake of blue intense,Under tempest lashed to foam,Lurid radiance, as he passed,Filled him, and around was glassed,When deepvoiced he uttered, Rome!XVIIRome! the word was and like meatFlung to dogs the word was torn.
Soon Romes magic priests shall bleatRound their magic Pope forlorn!Loud they swore the king had swornVengeance on the Roman cheat,Ere he passed, as, grave and still,Danube through the shouting hillSworn it by his naked life!Eagle, snakes these women areTake them on the wing! but war,Smoking wars the warriors wife!Then for plunder! then for bridesWon without a winking priest! Danube whirled his train of tidesBlack toward the yellow East.
Make the bed for Attila!XVIIIChirrups of the trot afield,Hurrahs of the battlecharge,How they answered, how they pealed,When the morning rose and drewBow and javelin, lance and targe,In the nuptial casements view!Attila, my Attila!Down the hillspurs, out of tentsGlimmering in midforest, throughMists of the cool morning scents,Forth from cityalley, court,Arch, the bounding horsemen flew,Joined along the plains of dew,Raced and gave the rein to sport,Closed and streamed like curtainrentsFluttered by a wind, and flowedInto squadrons trumpets blew,Chargers neighed, and trappings glowedBrave as the bright Orients.
Look on the seas that run to greetSunrise look on the leagues of wheatLook on the lines and squares that fretLeaping to level the lance bloodwet.
Tens of thousands, man and steed,Tossing like fieldflowers in SpringReady to be hurled at needWhither their great lord may sling.
Finger Romeward, Romeward, King!Attila, my Attila!Still the woman holds him fastAs a nightflag round the mast.
XIXNigh upon the fiery noon,Out of ranks a roaring burst.
Ware white women like the moon!They are poison they have thirstFirst for love, and next for rule.
Jealous of the army, sheHo, the little wanton fool!We were his before she squealedBlind for mothers milk, and heeledKicking on her mothers knee.
His in life and death are weShe but one flower of a field.
We have given him bliss tenfoldIn an hour to match her nightAttila, my Attila!Still her arms the master hold,As on wounds the scarf winds tight.
XXOver Danube day no more,Like the warriors planted spear,Stood to hail the King in fearWestern day knocked at his door.
Attila, my Attila!Sudden in the armys eyesRolled a blast of lights and criesFlashing through them Dead are ye!Dead, ye Huns, and torn piecemeal!See the ordered army reelStricken through the ribs and see,Wild for speed to cheat despair,Horsemen, clutching knee to chin,Crouch and dart they know not where.
Attila, my Attila!Faces covered, faces bare,Light the palacefront like jetsOf a dreadful fire within.
Beating hands and driving hairStart on roof and parapets.
Dust rolls up the slaughter din.
 Death to them who call him dead!Death to them who doubt the tale!Choking in his dusty veil,Sank the sun on his deathbed.
Make the bed for Attila!XXITis the room where thunder sleeps.
Frenzy, as a wave to shoreSurging, burst the silent door,And drew back to awful deepsBreath beaten out, foamwhite.
 AnewHowled and pressed the ghastly crew,Like stormwaters over rocks.
Attila, my Attila!One long shaft of sunset redLaid a finger on the bed.
Horror, with the snaky locks,Shocked the surge to stiffened heaps,Hoary as the glaciers headFaced to the moon.
 Insane they look.
God it is in heaven who weepsFallen from his hand the Scourge he shook.
Make the bed for Attila!XXIISquare along the couch, and stark,Like the searejected thingSeasucked white, behold their King.
Attila, my Attila!Beams that panted black and bright,Scornful lightnings danced their sightHim they see an oak in bud,Him an oaklog stripped of barkHim, their lord of day and night,White, and lifting up his bloodDumb for vengeance.
 Name us that,Huddled in the corner darkHumped and grinning like a cat,Teeth for lips!tis she! she stares,Glittering through her bristled hairs.
Rend her! Pierce her to the hilt!She is Murder have her out!What! this little fist, as bigAs the southern summer fig!She is Madness, none may doubt.
Death, who dares deny her guilt!Death, who says his blood she spilt!Make the bed for Attila!XXIIITorch and lamp and sunsetredFell threefingered on the bed.
In the torch the beardhair scantWith the great breast seemed to pantIn the yellow lamp the limbsWavered, as the lakeflower swimsIn the sunset red the deadDead avowed him, dry bloodred.
XXIVHatred of that abject slave,Earth, was in each chieftains heart.
Earth has got him, whom God gave,Earth may sing, and earth shall smart!Attila, my Attila!XXVThus their prayer was raved and ceased.
Then had Vengeance of her feastScent in their quick pang to smiteWhich they knew not, but huge painUrged them for some victim slainSwift, and blotted from the sight.
Each at each, a crouching beast,Glared, and quivered for the word.
Each at each, and all on that,Humped and grinning like a cat,Headbound with its bridalwreath.
Then the bitter chamber heardVengeance in a cauldron seethe.
Hurried counsel rage and craftYelped to hungry men, whose teethHard the grey lipringlet gnawed,Gleaming till their fury laughed.
With the steelhilt in the clutch,Eyes were shot on her that frozeIn their bloodthirst overawedBurned to rend, yet feared to touch.
She that was his nuptial rose,She was of his hearts blood cladOh! the last of him she had! Could a little fist as bigAs the southern summer fig,Push a daggers point to pierceRibs like those Who else! They glaredEach at each.
 Suspicion fierceMany a black remembrance bared.
Attila, my Attila!Death, who dares deny her guilt!Death, who says his blood she spilt!Traitor he, who stands between!Swift to hell, who harms the Queen!She, the wild contentions cause,Combed her hair with quiet paws.
Make the bed for Attila!XXVINight was on the host in arms.
Night, as never night before,Hearkened to an armys roarBreaking up in snaky swarmsTorch and steel and snorting steed,Hunted by the cry of blood,Cursed with blindness, mad for day.
Where the torches ran a flood,Tales of him and of the deedShowered like a torrent spray.
Fear of silence made them striveLoud in warriorhymns that grewHoarse for slaughter yet unwreaked.
Ghostly Night across the hive,With a crimson finger drewLetters on her breast and shrieked.
Night was on them like the mouldOn the buried half alive.
Night, their bloody Queen, her foldWound on them and struck them through.
Make the bed for Attila!XXVIIEarth has got him whom God gave,Earth may sing, and earth shall smart!None of earth shall know his grave.
They that dig with Death depart.
Attila, my Attila!XXVIIIThus their prayer was raved and passedPassed in peace their red sunsetHewn and earthed those men of sweatWho had housed him in the vast,Where no mortal might declare,There lies hehis end was there!Attila, my Attila!XXIXKingless was the army leftOf its head the race bereft.
Every fury of the pitTortured and dismembered it.
Lo, upon a silent hour,When the pitch of frost subsides,Danube with a shout of powerLoosens his imprisoned tidesWide around the frighted plainsShake to hear his riven chains,Dreadfuller than heaven in wrath,As he makes himself a pathHigh leap the icecracks, towering pileFloes to bergs, and giant peersWrestle on a drifted isleIsland on iceisland rearsDissolution battles fastBig the senseless Titans loom,Through a mist of common doomStriving which shall die the lastTill a gentlebreathing mornFrees the stream from bank to bank.
So the Empire built of scornAgonized, dissolved and sank.
Of the Queen no more was toldThan of leaf on Danube rolled.

IIIYellow flamed the meady sunsetRed runs up the flag of morn.
Signal for the British onsetHiccups through the British horn.
Down these hillmen pour like cattleSniffing pasture grim below,Showing eager teeth of battle,In his spearheads lies the foe.

VIIThou, my Bard, didst hang thy lyre inOakleaves, and with crimson brandRhythmic fury spent, AneurinSongs the churls could understandThrumming on their Saxon sconcesStraight, the invariable blow,Till they snorted true responses.

Full of liquor, full of victory,Chief on chief old vengeance dealt.
Backward swung their hurlyburlyNone but dead men kept the fight.
They that drink their cup too early,Darkness they shall see ere night.
XLoud we heard the yellow roverLaugh to sleep, while we raged thick,Thick as ants the anthill over,Asking who has thrust the stick.

PERIANDERIHow died Melissa none dares shape in words.
A woman who is wife despotic lordsCount faggot at the question, Shall she live!Her son, because his brows were black of her,Runs barking for his bread, a fugitive,And Corinth frowns on them that feed the cur.
IIThere is no Corinth save the whip and curbOf Corinth, high Periander the superbIn magnanimity, in rule severe.
Up on his marble fortresstower he sits,The city under him a white yoked steer,That bears his heart for pulse, his head for wits.
IIIBloom of the generous fires of his fair SpringStill coloured him when men forbore to stingAdmiring meekly where the ordered seedsOf his good sovereignty showed gardens trimAnd owning that the hoe he struck at weedsWas author of the flowers raised face to him.
IVHis Corinth, to each mood subservientIn homage, made he as an instrumentTo yield him music with scarce touch of stops.
He breathed, it piped he moved, it rose to flyAt whiles a bloodhorse racing till it dropsAt whiles a crouching dog, on him all eye.
VHis wisdom men acknowledged only one,The creature, issue of him, Lycophron,That rebel with his mother in his brows,Contested such an infamous would foulPirene! Little heed where he might houseThe prince gave, hearing so the fox, the owl!VITo prove the Gods benignant to his rule,The years, which fasten rigid whom they cool,Reviewing, saw him hold the seat of power.
A grey one asked Who next nor answer hadOne greyer pointed on the pallid hourTo come a river dried of waters glad.
VIIFor which of his male issue promised gripTo stride yon people, with the curb and whipThis Lycophron! he sole, the father like,Fired prospect of a line in one strong tide,By right of mastery stern will to strikePride to support the stroke yea, Godlike pride!VIIIHimself the prince beheld a failing fount.
His line stretched back unto its holy mountThe thirsty onward waved for him no sign.
Then stood before his vision that hard son.
The seizure of a passion for his lineImpelled him to the path of Lycophron.
IXThe youth was tossing pebbles in the seaA figure shunned along the busy quay,Perforce of the harsh edict for who daredAddress him outcast.
 Naming it, he crossedHis fathers look with look that proved them pairedFor stiffness, and another pebble tossed.
XAn exile to the Island ere nightfallHe passed from sight, from the hushed mouths of all.
It had resemblance to a death and on,Against a coast where sapphire shattered white,The seasons rolled like troops of billows blownTo spraymist.
 The prince gazed on capping night.
XIDeaf Age spake in his ear with shouts Thy son!Deep from his heart Life raved of work not done.
He heard historic echoes moan his name,As of the prince in whom the race had pauseTill Tyranny paternity became,And him he hated loved he for the cause.
XIINot Lycophron the exile now appeared,But young Periander, from the shadow cleared,That haunted his rebellious brows.
 The princeGrew bright for him saw youth, if seeming loth,Return and of pure pardon to convince,Despatched the messenger most dear with both.
XIIIHis daughter, from the exiles Island home,Wrote, as a flight of halcyons oer the foam,Sweet words her brother to his father bowedAccepted his peaceoffering, and rejoiced.
To bring him back a prince the father vowed,Commanded man the oars, the white sails hoist.
XIVHe waved the fleet to strain its westward wayOn to the seahued hills that crown the baySoil of those hospitable islandersWhom now his heart, for honour to his blood,Thanked.
 They should learn what boons a prince confersWhen happiness enjoins him gratitude!XVIn watch upon the offing, worn with hasteTo see his youth revived, and, close embraced,Pardon who had subdued him, who had gainedSurely the stoutest battle between twoSince Titan pierced by young Apollo stainedEarths breast, the prince looked forth, himself looked through.
XVIErrors aforetime unperceived were bared,To be by his young masterful repairedRenewed his great ideas gone to smokeHis policy confirmed amid the surgeOf States and people fretting at his yoke.
And lo, the fleet brownflocked on the seaverge!XVIIOars pulled they streamed in harbour without cheerFor welcome shadowed round the heaving bier.
They, whose approach in such rare pomp and stressOf numbers the free islanders dismayedAt Tyranny come masking to oppress,Found Lycophron this breathless, this lonelaid.
XVIIIWho smote the man thrown open to young joyThe image of the mother of his boyCame forth from his unwary breast in wreaths,With eyes.
 And shall a woman, that extinct,Smite out of dust the Powerful who breathesHer loved the son her served they lay closelinked!XIXDead was he, and demanding earth.
 DemandSharper for vengeance of an instant hand,The Tyrant in the father heard him cry,And raged a plague to prove on free HellenesHow prompt the Tyrant for the Persian dyeHow black his Gods behind their marble screens.
SOLONIThe Tyrant passed, and friendlier was his eyeOn the great man of Athens, whom for foeHe knew, than on the sycophantic fryThat broke as waters round a galleys flow,Bubbles at prow and foam along the wake.
Solidity the Thunderer could not shake,Beneath an adverse wind still stripping bare,His kinsman, of the lightincavern look,From thought drew, and a countenance could wearNot less at peace than fields in Attic airShorn, and shown fruitful by the reapers hook.
IIMost enviable so yet much insaneTo deem of minds of men they grow! these sheep,By fits wild horses, need the crook and reinHot bulls by fits, pure wisdom hold they cheap,My Lawgiver, when fiery is the mood.
For ones and twos and threes thy words are goodFor thine own government are pillars mineStand acts to fit the herd which has quick thirst,Rejecting elegiacs, though they shineOn polished brass, and, worthy of the Nine,In showering columns from their fountain burst.
IIIThus museful rode the Tyrant, princely plumed,To his high seat upon the sacred rockAnd Solon, blank beside his rule, resumedThe meditation which that passing mockHad buffeted awhile to sallowness.
He little loved the man, his office less,Yet owned him for a flower of his kind.
Therefore the heavier curse on Athens he!The people grew not in themselves, but, blind,Accepted sight from him, to him resignedTheir hopes of stature, rootless as at sea.
IVAs under sea lay Solons work, or seemedBy turbid shorewaves beaten day by dayDefaced, half formless, like an image dreamed,Or child that fashioned in another clayAppears, by strangers hands to home returned.
But shall the Present tyrannize us earnedIt was in some way, justly says the sage.
One sees not how, while husbanding regretsWhile tossing scorn abroad from righteous rage,High vision is obscured for this is ageWhen robbedmore infant than the babe it frets!VYet see Athenians treading the black pathLaid by a princes shadow! well contentTo wait his pleasure, shivering at his wrathThey bow to their accepted OrientWith offer of the all that renders brightForgetful of the growth of men to light,As creatures reared on Persian milk they bow.
Unripe! unripe! The times are overcast.
But still may they who sowed behind the ploughTrue seed fix in the mind an unborn NOWTo make the plagues afflicting us things past.
BELLEROPHONIMaimed, beggared, grey seeking an alms with nodOf palsy doing task of thanks for breadUpon the stature of a God,He whom the Gods have struck bends low his head.
IIWeak words he has, that slip the nerveless tongueDeformed, like his great frame a broken arcOnce radiant as the javelin flungRight at the centre breastplate of his mark.
IIIOft pausing on his whiteeyed inward look,Some undermountain narrative he tells,As gapped by Lykian heat the brookCut from the source that in the upland swells.
IVThe cottagers who dole him fruit and crustWith patient inattention hear him prateAnd comes the snow, and comes the dust,Comes the old wanderer, more bent of late.
VA crazy beggar grateful for a mealHas ever of himself a world to say.
For them he is an ancient wheelSpinning a knotted thread the livelong day.
VIHe cannot, nor do they, the tale connectFor never singer in the land had beenWho him for theme did not rejectSpurned of the hoof that sprang the Hippocrene.
VIIAlbeit a theme of flame to bring them straightThe snorting whitewinged brother of the wave,They hear him as a thing by fateCursed in unholy babble to his grave.
VIIIAs men that spied the wings, that heard the snort,Their sires have told and of a martial princeBestriding him and old reportSpeaks of a monster slain by one long since.
IXThere is that story of the golden bitBy Goddess given to tame the lightning steedA mortal who could mount, and sitFlying, and up Olympus midway speed.
XHe rose like the loosed fountains utmost leapHe played the star at span of heaven right oerMens heads they saw the snowy steep,Saw the winged shoulders him they saw not more.
XIHe fell and says the shattered man, I fellAnd sweeps an arm the height an eagle winsAnd in his breast a mouthless wellHeaves the worn patches of his coat of skins.
XIILo, this is he in whom the surgent springsOf recollections richer than our skiesTo feed the flow of tuneful strings,Show but a pool of scum for shooting flies.
PHAETHONATTEMPTED IN THE GALLIAMBIC MEASUREAt the coming up of Phoebus the allluminous charioteer,Doublevisaged stand the mountains in imperial multitudes,And with shadows dappled men sing to him, Hail, O Beneficent!For they shudder chill, the earthvales, at his clouding, shudder toblackIn the light of him there is music thro the poplar and riversedge,Renovation, chirp of brooks, hum of the forestan oceansong.
Never pearl from oceanhollows by the diver exultingly,In his breathlessness, above thrust, is as earth to Helios.
Who usurps his place there, rashest Aphrodites loved one it is!To his son the flaming SunGod, to the tender youth, Phaethon,Rule of day this day surrenders as a thing hereditary,Having sworn by Styx tremendous, for the proof of his parentage,He would grant his sons petition, whatsoever the sign thereof.
Then, rejoiced, the stripling answered Rule of day give me giveit me,Give me place that men may see me how I blaze, and transcendinglyI, divine, proclaim my birthright.
 Darkened Helios, and hisutteranceChoked prophetic O half mortal! he exclaimed in an agony,O lost son of mine! lost son! No! put a prayer for another thingNot for this insane to wish it, and to crave the gift impious!Cannot other gifts my godhead shed upon thee miraculousMighty gifts to prove a blessing, that to earth thou shalt be a joyGifts of healing, wherewith men walk as the Gods beneficentlyAs a God to sway to concord hearts of men, reconciling themGifts of verse, the lyre, the laurel, therewithal that thine originShall be known even as when I strike on the stringd shell withmelody,And the golden notes, like medicine, darting straight to thecavities,Fill them up, till hearts of men bound as the billows, the shipsthereon.
Thus intently urged the SunGod but the force of his eloquenceWas the pressing on of seawaves scattered broad from the rocksaway.
What shall move a soul from madness Lost, lost in delirium,Rockfast, the adolescent to his father, irreverent,By the oath! the oath! thine oath! cried.
 The effulgent foreseerthen,Quivering in his loins parental, on the boys beaming countenanceLooked and moaned, and urged him for loves sake, for sweet lifessake, to yield the claim,To abandon his mad hunger, and avert the calamity.
But he, vehement, passionate, called out Let me show I am what Isay,That the taunts I hear be silenced I am stung with theirwhispering.
Only, Thou, my Father, Thou tell how aloft the revolving wheels,How aloft the cleaving horsecrests I may guide peremptorily,Till I drink the shadows, firehot, like a flower celestial,And my fellows see me curbing the fierce steeds, the dear dewdrinkersYea, for this I gaze on lifes light throw for this any sacrifice.
All the end foreseeing, Phoebus to his oath irrevocableBowed obedient, deploring the insanity pitiless.
Then the flameoutsnorting horses were led forth it was sodecreed.
They were yoked before the glad youth by his sisterancillaries.
Swift the ripple ripples followd, as of aureate Helicon,Down their flanks, while they impatient pawed desire of thedistances,And the bit with fury champed.
 Oh! unimaginable delight!Unimagined speed and splendour in the circle of upper air!Glory grander than the armed host upon earth singing victory!Chafed the youth with their spirit surcharged, as when blossom isshaken by winds,Marked that labour by his sister Phaethontiades finished, quickOn the slope of the car his forefoot set assured and the morningroseSeeing whom, and what a day dawned, stood the God, as in harvestfields,When the reaper grasps the full sheaf and the sickle that severs itHugged the withered head with one hand, with the other, to indicateIf this woe might be averted, this immeasurable evil,Laid the kindling course in view, told how the reins to manipulateNamed the horses fondly, fearful, cautiond urgently betweenwhilesTheir diverging tempers dwelt on, and their wantonness, wickedness,That the voice of Gods alone held in restraint but the voice ofGodsNone but Gods can curb.
 He spake vain were the words scarcelylistening,Mounted Phaethon, swinging reins loose, and, Behold me, companions,It is I here, I! he shouted, glancing down with supremacyNot to any of you was this gift granted ever in annals of menI alone what only Gods can, I alone am governing day!Short the triumph, brief his rapture see a hurricane suddenlyBeat the lifting billow crestless, roll it broken this way and thatAt the leap on yielding ether, in despite of his reprimand,Swayed tumultuous the firesteeds, plunging reckless hither and yonUnto men a great amazement, all agaze at the Troubled EastPitifully for mastery striving in ascension, the charioteer,Reminiscent, drifts of counsel caught confused in his arid witsThe reins stiff ahind his shoulder madly pulled for the mastery,Till a thunder off the tense chords thro his ears dinned horrible.
Panic seized him fled his vision of inviolabilityFled the dream that he of mortals rode mischances predominantAnd he cried, Had I petitioned for a cup of chill aconite,My descent to awful Hades had been soft, for now must I goWith the curse by father Zeus cast on ambition immoderate.
Oh, my sisters! Thou, my Goddess, in whose love I was enviable,From whose arms I rushed befrenzied, what a wreck will this body be,That admired of thee stood rosewarm in the courts where thymysteriesCelebration had from me, me the most splendidly privileged!Never more shall I thy temple fill with incenses bewilderingNot again hear thy halfmurmursI am lost!never, never more.
I am wrecked on seas of air, hurled to my death in a vessel offlame!Hither, sisters! Father, save me! Hither, succour me, Cypria!Now a wail of men to Zeus rang from Olympus the ThundererSaw the rage of the havoc widemouthed, the bright carsuperimpendingOver Asia, Africa, low down ruin flaming over the valesLight disastrous rising savage out of smoke inveteratelyBeastblack, conflagration like a menacing shadow moveWith voracious roaring southward, where aslant, insufferable,The bright steeds careered their parched way down an arc of thefirmament.
For the day grew like to thick night, and the orb was its beaconfire,And from hill to hill of darkness burst the days apparition forth.
Lo, a wrestler, not a God, stood in the chariot ever loweringLo, the shape of one who raced there to outstrip the legitimatehoursLo, the ravishd beams of Phoebus dragged in shame at the chariotwheelsLight of days of happy pipings by the meadsinging rivulets!Lo, lo, increasing lustre, torrid breath to the nostrils lo,Torrid brilliancies thro the vapours lighten swifter, penetratethem,Fasten merciless, ruminant, hueless, on earths frame cracklingbusily.
He aloft, the frenzied driver, in the glow of the universe,Like the paling of the dawnstar withers visibly, he aloftBitter fury in his aspect, bitter death in the heart of him.
Crouch the herds, contract the reptiles, crouch the lions undertheir paws.
White as metal in the furnace are the faces of humankindInarticulate creatures of earth dumb all await the ultimate shock.
To the bolt he launched, Strike dead, thou, uttered Zeus, veryterriblePerish folly, else tis mans fate and the bolt flew unerringly.
Then the kindler stooped from the torchcar down the measurelessaltitudesLeaned his rayless head, relinquished rein and footing, raised not acry.
Like the flower on the rivers surface when expanding it vanishes,Gave his limbs to right and left, quenched and so fell heprecipitate,Seen of men as a glad rainfall, sending coolness yet ere it comesSo he showered above them, shadowed oer the blue archipelagoes,Oer the silkenshining pastures of the continents and the islesSo descending brought revival to the greenery of our earth.
Lither, noisy in the breezes now his sisters shivering weep,By the river flowing smooth out to the vexed sea of Adria,Where he fell, and where they suffered sudden change to thetremulousEverwailful trees bemoaning him, a bruised purple cyclamen.
SEEDTIMEIFlowers of the willowherb are woolFlowers of the briar berries redSpeeding their seed as the breeze may rule,Flowers of the thistle loosen the thread.
Flowers of the clematis drip in beard,Slack from the firtree youngly climbedChaplets in air, flies foliage searedHeeled upon earth, lie clusters rimed.
IIWhere were skies of the mantle stainedOrange and scarlet, a coat of friezeTravels from North till day has waned,Tattered, soaked in the ditchs dyesTumbles the rook under grey or slateElse enfolding us, damps to the boneNarrows the world to my neighbours gatePaints me Life as a wheezy crone.
IIINow seems none but the spider lordStar in circle his web waits prey,Silvering bushmounds, blue brushing swardSlow runs the hour, swift flits the ray.
Now to his threadshroud is he nigh,Nigh to the tangle where wings are sealed,He who frolicked the jewelled flyAll is adroop on the down and the weald.
IVMists more lone for the sheepbell enwrapNights that tardily let slip a mornPaler than moons, and on noontides lapFlame dies cold, like the rose late born.
Rose born late, born withered in bud! I, even I, for a zenith of sunCry, to fulfil me, nourish my bloodO for a day of the long light, one!VMaster the blood, nor read by chills,Earth admonishes Hast thou ploughed,Sown, reaped, harvested grain for the mills,Thou hast the light over shadow of cloud.
Steadily eyeing, before that wailAnimalinfant, thy mind began,Momently nearer me should sight fail,Plod in the track of the husbandman.
VIVerily now is our season of seed,Now in our Autumn and Earth discernsThem that have served her in them that can read,Glassing, where under the surface she burns,Quick at her wheel, while the fuel, decay,Brightens the fire of renewal and weDeath is the word of a bovine day,Know you the breast of the springing Tobe.
HARD WEATHERBursts from a rending East in flawsThe young green leaflets harrier, swornTo strew the garden, strip the shaws,And show our Spring with banner torn.
Was ever such virago mornThe wind has teeth, the wind has claws.
All the winds wolves through woods are loose,The wild winds falconry aloft.
Shrill underfoot the grassblade shrews,At gallop, clumped, and down the croftBestrid by shadows, beaten, tossedIt seems a scythe, it seems a rod.
The howl is up at the howls accostThe shivers greet and the shivers nod.
Is the land ship we are rolled, we driveTritonly, cleaving hiss and humWhirl with the dead, or mount or dive,Or down in dregs, or on in scum.
And drums the distant, pipes the near,And vale and hill are grey in grey,As when the surge is crumbling sheer,And seamews wing the haze of spray.
Cloudsare they bony witchesswarms,Darting swift on the robbers flight,Hurry an infant sky in armsIt peeps, it becks tis day, tis night.
Black while over the loop of blueThe swathe is closed, like shroud on corse.
Lo, as if swift the Furies flew,The Fates at heel at a cry to horse!Interpret me the savage whirrAnd is it Nature scourged, or she,Her offsprings executioner,Reducing land to barren seaBut is there meaning in a dayWhen this fierce angel of the air,Intent to throw, and haply slay,Can for what breath of life we bear,Exact the wrestleCall to mindThe many meanings glistening upWhen Nature to her nurslings kind,Hands them the fruitage and the cup!And seek we rich significanceNot otherwhere than with those tidesOf pleasure on the sunned expanse,Whose flow deludes, whose ebb deridesLook in the face of men who fareLockmouthed, a match in lungs and thewsFor this fierce angel of the air,To twist with him and take his bruise.
That is the face beloved of oldOf Earth, young mother of her broodNor broken for us shows the mouldWhen muscle is in mind renewedThough farther from her nature rude,Yet nearer to her spirits holdAnd though of gentler mood serene,Still forceful of her fountainjet.
So shall her blows be shrewdly met,Be luminously read the sceneWhere Life is at her grindstone set,That she may give us edgeing keen,String us for battle, till as playThe common strokes of fortune shower.
Such meaning in a daggerdayOur wits may clasp to wax in power.
Yea, feel us warmer at her breast,By spin of blood in lusty drill,Than when her honeyed hands caressed,And Pleasure, sapping, seemed to fill.
Behold the life at ease it drifts.
The sharpened life commands its course.
She winnows, winnows roughly sifts,To dip her chosen in her sourceContention is the vital force,Whence pluck they brain, her prize of gifts,Sky of the senses! on which height,Not disconnected, yet released,They see how spirit comes to light,Through conquest of the inner beast,Which Measure tames to movement sane,In harmony with what is fair.
Never is Earth misread by brainThat is the welling of her, thereThe mirror with one step beyond,For likewise is it voice and more,Benignest kinship bids respond,When wail the weak, and them restoreWhom days as fell as this may rive,While Earth sits ebon in her gloom,Us atomies of life aliveUnheeding, bent on life to come.
Her children of the labouring brain,These are the champions of the race,True parents, and the sole humane,With understanding for their base.
Earth yields the milk, but all her mindIs vowed to thresh for stouter stock.
Her passion for old giantkind,That scaled the mount, uphurled the rock,Devolves on them who read arightHer meaning and devoutly serveNor in her starlessness of nightPeruse her with the craven nerveBut even as she from grass to corn,To eagle high from grubbing mole,Prove in strong brain her noblest born,The station for the flight of soul.
THE SOUTHWESTERDay of the cloud in fleets! O dayOf wedded white and blue, that sailImmingled, with a footing rayIn shadowsandals down our vale! And swift to ravish golden meads,Swift up the run of turf it speeds,Thy bright of head and dark of heel,To where the hilltop flings on sky,As hawk from wrist or dust from wheel,The tiptoe sealers tossed to flyThee the last thunders caverned pealDelivered from a wailful nightAll dusky round thy cradled light,Those brineborn issues, now in bloomTransfigured, wreathed as ravens plumeAnd brionyleaf to watch thee lieDark eyebrows oer a dreamful eyeNigh opening till in the braidOf purpled vapours thou wert rosedTill that new babe a Goddess maidAppeared and vividly disclosedHer beat of life then crimson playedOn edges of the plume and leafShape had they and fair feature brief,The wings, the smiles they flew the breast,Earths milk.
 But what imperial marchTheir standards led for earth, none guessedEre upward of a coloured arch,An arrow straining eager headLightened, and high for zenith sped.
Fierier followed followed Fire.
Name the young lord of Earths desire,Whose look her wine is, and whose mouthHer music! Beauteous was she seenBeneath her midway West of SouthAnd sister was her quivered greenTo sapphire of the Nereid eyesOn sea when sun is breeze she winkedAs they, and waved, heaved waterwiseHer flood of leaves and grasses linkedA myriad lustrous butterfliesA moment in the fluttering sheenBecapped with the slate air that throwsThe reindeers antlers black betweenLowfrowning and widefallen snows,A minute after hooded, stoledTo suit a graveside Seasons dirge.
Lo, but the breaking of a surge,And she is in her lovers fold,Illumined oer a boundless rangeAnew and through quick morning hoursThe TropicArctic counterchargeDid seem to pant in beams and showers.
But noon beheld a larger heavenBeheld on our reflecting fieldThe Sower to the Bearer given,And both their inner sweetest yield,Fresh as when dews were grey or firstReceived the flush of hues athirst.
Heard we the woodland, eyeing sun,As harp and harper were they one.
A murky cloud a fair pursued,Assailed, and felt the limbs eludeHe sat him down to pipe his woe,And some strange beast of sky becameA giants club withheld the blowA milky cloud went all to flame.
And there were groups where silvery springsThe ethereal forest showed begirtBy companies in choric rings,Whom but to see made ear alert.
For music did each movement rouse,And motion was a minstrels rageTo have our spirits out of house,And bathe them on the open page.
This was a day that knew not age.
Since flew the vapoury twos and threesFrom western pile to eastern rackAs on from peaks of PyreneesTo Graians youngness ruled the track.
When songful beams were shut in caves,And rainy drapery swept acrossWhen the ranked clouds were downy waves,Breast of swan, eagle, albatross,In ordered lines to screen the blue,Youngest of light was nigh, we knew.
The silver finger of it laughedAlong the narrow rift it shot,Slew the huge gloom with golden shaft,Then haled on high the volumed blot,To build the hurling palace, cleaveThe dazzling chasm the flying nests,The many glorygarlands weave,Whose presence not our sight attestsTill wonder with the splendour blent,And passion for the beauty flown,Make evanescence permanent,The thing at heart our endless own.
Only at gathered eve knew weThe marvels of the day for thenMount upon mountain out of seaArose, and to our spacious kenTrebled sublime Olympus roundIn towering amphitheatre.
Colossal on enormous mound,Majestic gods we saw confer.
They wafted the DreammessengerFrom off the loftiest, the crownedThat Lady of the hues of foamIn sunrays who, close under dome,A figure on the foots descent,Irradiate to vapour went,As one whose mission was resigned,Dispieced, undraped, dissolved to threadsMelting she passed into the mind,Where immortal with mortal weds.
Whereby was known that we had viewedThe union of our earth and skiesRenewed nor less alive renewedThan when old bards, in nature wise,Conceived pure beauty given to eyes,And with undyingness imbued.
Pageant of mans poetic brain,His grand procession of the song,It was the Muses and their trainTheir God to lead the glittering throngAt whiles a beat of forest gongAt whiles a glimpse of Python slain.
Mostly divinest harmony,The lyre, the dance.
 We could believeA life in orb and brook and tree,And cloud and still holds MemoryA morning in the eyes of eve.
THE THRUSH IN FEBRUARYI know him, Februarys thrush,And loud at eve he valentinesOn sprays that paw the naked bushWhere soon will sprout the thorns and bines.
Now ere the foreign singer thrillsOur vale his plainsong pipe he pours,A herald of the million billsAnd heed him not, the loss is yours.
My study, flanked with ivied firAnd budded beech with dry leaves curled,Perched over yew and juniper,He neighbours, piping to his worldThe wooded pathways dank on brown,The branches on grey cloud a web,The long green roller of the down,An image of the delugeebbAnd farther, they may hear alongThe stream beneath the poplar row.
By fits, like welling rocks, the songSpouts of a blushful Spring in flow.
But most he loves to front the valeWhen waves of warm Southwestern rainsHave left our heavens clear in pale,With faintest beck of moist red veinsVermilion wings, by distance heldTo pause aflight while fleeting swiftAnd high aloft the pearl inshelledHer lucid glow in glow will liftA little south of coloured skyDirecting, gravely amorous,The human of a tender eyeThrough pure celestial on usRemote, not alien still, not coldUnraying yet, more pearl than starShe seems a while the vale to holdIn trance, and homelier makes the far.
Then Earth her sweet unscented breathes,An orb of lustre quits the heightAnd like blue irisflags, in wreathsThe sky takes darkness, long ere quite.
His Island voice then shall you hear,Nor ever after separateFrom such a twilight of the yearAdvancing to the vernal gate.
He sings me, out of Winters throat,The young time with the life aheadAnd my young time his leaping noteRecalls to spiritmirth from dead.
Imbedded in a land of greed,Of mammonquakings dire as Earths,My care was but to soothe my needAt peace among the littleworths.
To light and song my yearning aimedTo that deep breast of song and lightWhich men have barrenest proclaimedAs tis to senses pricked with fright.
So mine are these new fruitings richThe simple to the common bringsI keep the youth of souls who pitchTheir joy in this old heart of thingsWho feel the Coming young as aye,Thrice hopeful on the ground we ploughAlive for life, awake to dieOne voice to cheer the seedling Now.
Full lasting is the song, though he,The singer, passes lasting too,For souls not lent in usury,The rapture of the forward view.
With that I bear my senses fraughtTill what I am fast shoreward drives.
They are the vessel of the Thought.
The vessel splits, the Thought survives.
Nought else are we when sailing brave,Save husks to raise and bid it burn.
Glimpse of its livingness will waveA light the senses can discernAcross the river of the death,Their close.
 Meanwhile, O twilight birdOf promise! bird of happy breath!I hear, I would the City heard.
The City of the smoky frayA prodded ox, it drags and moansIts Morrow no mans child its DayA vultures morsel beaked to bones.
It strives without a mark for strifeIt feasts beside a famished hostThe loose restraint of wanton life,That threatened penance in the ghost!Yet there our battle urges thereSpring heroes many issuing thence,Names that should leave no vacant airFor fresh delight in confidence.
Life was to them the bag of grain,And Death the weedy harrows tooth.
Those warriors of the sighting brainGive worn Humanity new youth.
Our song and star are they to leadThe tidal multitude and blindFrom bestial to the higher breedBy fighting souls of love divined,They scorned the ventral dream of peace,Unknown in nature.
 This they knewThat life begets with fair increaseBeyond the flesh, if life be true.
Just reason based on valiant blood,The instinct bred afield would matchTo pipe thereof a swelling flood,Were men of Earth made wise in watch.
Though now the numbers count as dropsAn urn might bear, they father Time.
She shapes anew her dusty cropsHer quick in their own likeness climb.
Of their own force do they createThey climb to light, in her their root.
Your brutish cry at muffled fateShe smites with pangs of worse than brute.
She, judged of shrinking nerves, appearsA Mother whom no cry can meltBut read her past desires and fears,The letters on her breast are spelt.
A slayer, yea, as when she pressedHer savage to the slaughterheaps,To sacrifice she prompts her bestShe reaps them as the sower reaps.
But read her thought to speed the race,And stars rush forth of blackest nightYou chill not at a cold embraceTo come, nor dread a dubious might.
Her double visage, double voice,In oneness rise to quench the doubt.
This breath, her gift, has only choiceOf service, breathe we in or out.
Since Pain and Pleasure on each handLed our wild steps from slimy rockTo yonder sweeps of gardenland,We breathe but to be sword or block.
The sighting brain her good decreeAccepts obeys those guides, in faith,By reason hourly fed, that she,To some the clod, to some the wraith,Is more, no mask a flame, a stream.
Flame, stream, are we, in mid careerFrom torrent source, delirious dream,To heavenreflecting currents clear.
And why the sons of Strength have beenHer cherished offspring ever howThe Spirit served by her is seenThrough Law perusing love will show.
Love born of knowledge, love that gainsVitality as Earth it mates,The meaning of the Pleasures, Pains,The Life, the Death, illuminates.
For love we Earth, then serve we allHer mystic secret then is oursWe fall, or view our treasures fall,Unclouded, as beholds her flowersEarth, from a night of frosty wreck,Enrobed in mornings mounted fire,When lowly, with a broken neck,The crocus lays her cheek to mire.
THE APPEASEMENT OF DEMETERIDemeter devastated our good land,In blackness for her daughter snatched below.
Smokepillar or loose hillock was the sand,Where soil had been to clasp warm seed and throwThe wheat, vine, olive, ripe to Summers ray.
Now whether night advancing, whether day,Scarce did the baldness showThe hand of man was a defeated hand.
IINecessity, the primal goad to growth,Stood shrunken Youth and Age appeared as oneLike Winter Summer good as labour slothNor was there answer wherefore beamed the sun,Or why men drew the breath to carry pain.
High reared the ploughshare, broken lay the wain,Idly the flaxwheel spunUnridered starving lords were wasp and moth.
IIILean grassblades losing green on their bent flags,Sang chilly to themselves lone honeybeesPursued the flowers that were not with dry bagsSole sound aloud the snap of sapless trees,More sharp than slingstones on hard breastplates hurled.
Back to first chaos tumbled the stopped world,Careless to lure or please.
A nature of gaunt ribs, an earth of crags.
IVNo smile Demeter cast the gloom she saw,Well draped her direful musing for in gloom,In thicker gloom, deep down the cavernmaw,Her sweet had vanished liker unto whom,And whose pale place of habitation mute,She and all seemed where Seasons, pledged for fruitAnciently, gaped for bloomWhere hand of man was as a plucked fowls claw.
VThe wrathful Queen descended on a vale,That ere the ravished hour for richness heaved.
Iambe, maiden of the merry tale,Beside her eyed the once redcheeked, greenleaved.
It looked as if the Deluge had withdrawn.
Pity caught at her throat her jests were gone.
More than for her who grieved,She could for this waste home have piped the wail.
VIIambe, her dear mountainrivuletTo waken laughter from cold stones, beheldA riven wheatfield cracking for the wet,And seed like infants teeth, that never swelled,Apeep up flinty ridges, milkless round.
Teeth of the giants marked she where thin groundRocky in spikes rebelledAgainst the hand here slack as rotted net.
VIIThe valley people up the ashen scoopShe beckoned, aiming hopelessly to winHer Mistress in compassion of yon groupSo pinched and wizened with their aged grin,For lack of warmth to smile on mouths of woe,White as in chalk outlining little O,Dumb, from a falling chinYoung, old, alike halfbent to make the hoop.
VIIITheir tongues of birds they wagged, weakvoiced as whenDark underwaters the recesses chokeWith cluck and upper quiver of a henIn grasp, past peeking cry before the croak.
Relentlessly their goldhaired Heaven, their fountBountiful of old days, heard them recountThis and that cruel strokeNor eye nor ear had she for piteous men.
IXA figure of black rock by sunbeams crownedThrough stormclouds, where the volumed shades enfoldAn earth in awe before the claps resoundAnd woods and dwellings are as billows rolled,The barren Nourisher unmelted shedDeath from the looks that wandered with the deadOut of the realms of gold,In famine for her lost, her lost unfound.
XIambe from her Mistress tripped she raisedThe cattlecall above the moan of prayerAnd slowly out of fields their fancy grazed,Among the droves, defiled a horse and mareThe wrecks of horse and mare such ribs as viewSeas that have struck brave ships ashore, while throughShoots the swift foamspit bareThey nodded, and Demeter on them gazed.
XIHowbeit the season of the dancing blood,Forgot was horse of mare, yea, mare of horseReversed, each head at eithers flank, they stood.
Whereat the Goddess, in a dim remorse,Laid hand on them, and smacked and her touch pricked.
Neighing within, at eithers flank they lickedPlayed on a moments forceAt courtship, withering to the crazy nod.
XIIThe nod was that we gather for consentAnd mournfully amid the group a dame,Interpreting the thing in nature meant,Her hands held out like bearers of the flame,And nodded for the negative sideways.
Keen at her Mistress glanced Iambe raysFrom the Great Mother cameHer lips were opened wide the curse was rent.
XIIIShe laughed since our first harvesting heard noneLike thunder of the song of heart her face,The dreadful darkness, shook to mounted sun,And peal on peal across the hills held chase.
She laughed herself to water laughed to fireLaughed the torrential laugh of dam and sireFull of the marrowy race.
Her laughter, Gods! was flesh on skeleton.
XIVThe valley people huddled, broke, afraid,Assured, and taking lightning in the veins,They puffed, they leaped, linked hands, together swayed,Unwitting happiness till golden rainsOf tears in laughter, laughter weeping, smoteKnowledge of milky mercy from that throatPouring to heal their painsAnd one bold youth set mouth at a shy maid.
XVIambe clapped to see the kindly lustsInspire the valley people, still on seas,Like poplartops relieved from stress of gusts,With rapture in their wonderment but these,Low homage being rendered, ran to plough,Fed by the laugh, as by the mother cowCalves at the teats they teaseSoon drove they through the yielding furrowcrusts.
XVIUprose the blade in green, the leaf in red,The tree of water and the tree of woodAnd soon among the branches overheadGave beauty juicy issue sweet for food.
O Laughter! beauty plumped and love had birth.
Laughter! O thou reviver of sick Earth!Good for the spirit, goodFor body, thou! to both art wine and bread!EARTH AND A WEDDED WOMANIThe shepherd, with his eye on hazy South,Has told of rain upon the fall of day.
But promise is there none for Susans drouth,That he will come, who keeps in dry delay.
The freshest of the village three years gone,She hangs as the white fieldrose hangs shortlivedAnd she and Earth are oneIn withering unrevived.
Rain! O the glad refresher of the grain!And welcome waterspouts, had we sweet rain!IIAh, what is Marriage, says each pouting maid,When she who wedded with the soldier hidesAt home as good as widowed in the shade,A lighthouse to the girls that would be bridesNor dares to give a lad an ogle, norTo dream of dancing, but must hang and moan,Her husband in the war,And she to lie alone.
Rain! O the glad refresher of the grain!And welcome waterspouts, had we sweet rain!IIIThey have not known they are not in the streamLight as the flying seedball is their play,The silly maids! and happy souls they seemYet Grief would not change fates with such as they.
They have not struck the roots which meet the firesBeneath, and bind us fast with Earth, to knowThe strength of her desires,The sternness of her woe.
Rain! O the glad refresher of the grain!And welcome waterspouts, had we sweet rain!IVNow, shepherd, see thy word, where without showerA borderless low blotting Westward spreads.
The hallclock holds the valley on the hourAcross an inner chamber thunder treadsThe dead leaf trips, the treetop swings, the floorOf dust whirls, dropping lumped near thunder speaks,And drives the dames to door,Their kerchiefs flapped at cheeks.
Rain! O the glad refresher of the grain!And welcome waterspouts of blessed rain!VThrough night, with bedroom window wide for air,Lay Susan tranced to hear all heaven descendAnd gurgling voices came of Earth, and rare,Past flowerful, breathings, deeper than lifes end,From her heaved breast of sacred common mouldWhereby this lonelaid wife was moved to feelUnworded things and oldTo her pained heart appeal.
Rain! O the glad refresher of the grain!And down in deluges of blessed rain!VIAt morn she stood to live for ear and sight,Love sky or cloud, or rose or grasses drenched.
A lureful devil, that in glowworm lightSet languor writhing all its folds, she quenched.
But she would muse when neighbours praised her face,Her services, and staunchness to her mateKnowing by some dim trace,The change might bear a date.
Rain! O the glad refresher of the grain!Thrice beauteous is our sunshine after rain!MOTHER TO BABEIFleck of sky you are,Dropped through branches dark,O my little one, mine!Promise of the star,Outpour of the larkBeam and song divine.
IISee this precious gift,Steeping in new birthAll my being, for signEarth to heaven can lift,Heaven descend on earth,Both in one be mine!IIILife in light you glassWhen you peep and coo,You, my little one, mine!Brooklet chirps to grass,Daisy looks in dewUp to dear sunshine.
WOODLAND PEACESweet as Eden is the air,And Edensweet the ray.
No Paradise is lost for themWho foot by branching root and stem,And lightly with the woodland shareThe change of night and day.
Here all say,We serve her, even as IWe brood, we strive to sky,We gaze upon decay,We wot of life through death,How each feeds each we spyAnd is a tangle round,Are patient what is dumbWe question not, nor askThe silent to give sound,The hidden to unmask,The distant to draw near.
And this the woodland saithI know not hope or fearI take whateer may comeI raise my head to aspects fair,From foul I turn away.
Sweet as Eden is the air,And Edensweet the ray.
THE QUESTION WHITHERIWhen we have thrown off this old suit,So much in need of mending,To sink among the naked mute,Is that, think you, our endingWe follow many, more we lead,And you who sadly turf us,Believe not that all living seedMust flower above the surface.
IISensation is a gracious gift,But were it cramped to station,The prayer to have it cast adriftWould spout from all sensation.
Enough if we have winked to sun,Have sped the plough a seasonThere is a soul for labour done,Endureth fixed as reason.
IIIThen let our trust be firm in Good,Though we be of the fastingOur questions are a mortal brood,Our work is everlasting.
We children of BeneficenceAre in its being sharersAnd Whither vainer sounds than Whence,For word with such wayfarers.
OUTER AND INNERIFrom twig to twig the spider weavesAt noon his webbing fine.
So near to mute the zephyrs fluteThat only leaflets dance.
The sun draws out of hazel leavesA smell of woodland wine.
I wake a swarm to sudden stormAt any steps advance.
IIAlong my path is bugloss blue,The star with fruit in mossThe foxgloves drop from throat to topA daily lesser bell.
The blackest shadow, nurse of dew,Has orange skeins acrossAnd keenly red is one thin threadThat flashing seems to swell.
IIIMy world I note ere fancy comes,Minutest hushed observeWhat busy bits of motioned witsThrough antlered mosswork strive.
But now so low the stillness hums,My springs of seeing swerve,For half a wink to thrill and thinkThe woods with nymphs alive.
IVI neighbour the invisibleSo close that my consentIs only asked for spirits maskedTo leap from trees and flowers.
And this because with them I dwellIn thought, while calmly bentTo read the lines dear Earth designsShall speak her life on ours.
VAccept, she says it is not hardIn woods but she in townsRepeats, accept and have we wept,And have we quailed with fears,Or shrunk with horrors, sure rewardWe have whom knowledge crownsWho see in mould the rose unfold,The soul through blood and tears.
NATURE AND LIFEILeave the uproar at a leapThou shalt strike a woodland path,Enter silence, not of sleep,Under shadows, not of wrathBreath which is the spirits bathIn the old Beginnings find,And endow them with a mind,Seed for seedling, swathe for swathe.
That gives Nature to us, thisGive we her, and so we kiss.
IIFruitful is it so but hearHow within the shell thou art,Music sounds nor other nearCan to such a tremor start.
Of the waves our life is partThey our running harvests bearBack to them for manful air,Laden with the woodlands heart!That gives Battle to us, thisGive we it, and good the kiss.
DIRGE IN WOODSA wind sways the pines,And belowNot a breath of wild airStill as the mosses that glowOn the flooring and over the linesOf the roots here and there.
The pinetree drops its deadThey are quiet, as under the sea.
Overhead, overheadRushes life in a race,As the clouds the clouds chaseAnd we go,And we drop like the fruits of the tree,Even we,Even so.
A FAITH ON TRIALOn the morning of May,Ere the children had entered my gateWith their wreaths and mechanical lay,A metal dingdong of the date!I mounted our hill, bearing heartThat had little of life save its weightThe crowned Shadow poising dartHung over her she, my own,My good companion, mate,Pulse of me she who had shownFortitude quiet as EarthsAt the shedding of leaves.
 And aroundThe sky was in garlands of cloud,Winning scents from unnumbered new births,Pointed buds, where the woods were brownedBy a mouldered beechen shroudOr over our meads of the vale,Such an answer to sun as he,Brave in his gold to a sound,None sweeter, of woods flapping sail,With the first full flood of our year,For their voyage on lustreful seaUnto what curtained haven in chief,Will be writ in the book of the sere.
But surely the crew are we,Eager or stamped or bowedCounted thinner at fall of the leaf.
Grief heard them, and passed like a bier.
Due Summerward, lo, they were set,In volumes of foliage proud,On the heave of their favouring tides,And their song broadened out to the cheerWhen a neck of the ramping surfRattles thunder a boat overrides.
All smiles ran the highways wetThe worm drew its links from the turfThe bird of felicity loudSpun high, and a South wind blew.
Weak out of sheath downy leavesOf the beech quivered lucid as dew,Their radiance asking, who grievesFor nought of a sorrow they knewNo space to the dread wrestle vowed,No chamber in shadow of night.
At times as the steadier breezeFlutterhuddled their twigs to a crowd,The beam of them wafted my sightTo leaguelong sun upon seasThe golden path we had crossedMany years, till her birthland swungRecovered to vision from lost,A light in her filial glance.
And sweet was her voice with the tongue,The speechful tongue of her France,Soon at ripple about us, like rillsEver busy with little awayThrough her Normandy, down where the millsDot at lengths a rivercourse, greyAs its bordering poplars bentTo gusts off the plains above.
Old stone chateau and farms,Home of her birth and her love!On the thread of the pasture you trace,By the river, their milk, for miles,Spotted once with the English tent,In days of the tocsins alarms,To tower of the tallest of piles,The countrys surveyor breasthigh.
Home of her birth and her love!Home of a diligent raceThrifty, defthanded to plyShuttle or needle, and wooSun to the roots of the pearFrogging each mudwalled cot.
The elders had known her in arms.
There plucked we the bluet, her hueOf the deeper forgetmenotWell wedding her ripewheat hair.
I saw, unsighting her heartI saw, and the home of her loveThere printed, mournfully rentHer ebbing adieu, her adieu,And the stride of the Shadow athwart.
For one of our Autumns there! .
 .
 .
Straight as the flight of a doveWe went, swift winging we went.
We trod solid ground, we breathed air,The heavens were unbroken.
 Break they,The word of the world is adieuHer word and the torrents are round,The jawed wolfwaters of prey.
We stand upon isles, who standA Shadow before us, and back,A phantom the habited land.
We may cry to the Sunderer, spareThat dearest! he loosens his pack.
Arrows we breathe, not air.
The memories tenderly boundTo us are a drifting crew,Amid greygapped waters for ground.
Alone do we stand, each one,Till rootless as they we strewThose deeps of the corselike stareAt a foreign and stony sun.
Eyes had I but for the sceneOf my circle, what neighbourly grew.
If haply no finger lay outTo the figures of days that had been,I gathered my herb, and enduredMy old cloak wrapped me about.
Unfooted was groundivy blue,Whose rustic shrewd odour alluredIn Springs fresh of morning unseenHer favourite woodsorrel bellAs yet, though the leaves green floorAwaited their flower, that would tellOf a redveined moist yestreen,With its droop and the hues it wore,When we two stood overnightOne, in the dark vanglowOn our hilltop, seeing beneathOur households twinkle of lightThrough spruceboughs, gem of a wreath.
Budding, the servicetree, whiteAlmost as whitebeam, threw,From the under of leaf upright,Flecks like a showering snowOn the flameshaped junipers green,On the sombre mounds of the yew.
Like silvery tapers brightBy a solemn cathedral screen,They glistened to closer view.
Turf for a rooks revel stripedPleased those devourers astute.
Chorister blackbird and thrushTogether or alternate pipedA freehearted harmony large,With meaning for man, for brute,When the primitive forces are brimmed.
Like featherings hither and yonOf aery treetwigs over marge,To the comb of the winds, untrimmed,Their measure is found in the vast.
Grief heard them, and stepped her way on.
She has but a narrow embrace.
Distrustful of hearing she passed.
They piped her young Earths Bacchic routThe race, and the prize of the raceEarths lustihead pressing to sprout.
But sight holds a soberer space.
Colourless dogwood lowCurled up a twisted root,Nigh yellowgreen mosses, to flushRedder than sun upon rocks,When the creeper clematisshootShall climb, cap his branches, and show,Beside veteran green of the box,At close of the years maple blush,A bleeding greybeard is he,Now hale in the leafage lush.
Our parasites paint us.
 Hard by,A wet yewtrunk flashed the peelOf our naked forefathers in fightWith stains of the fray sweating freeAnd him came no parasite nighFirm on the hard knotted knee,He stood in the crown of his dunEarths toughest to stay her wheelUnder whom the full day is nightWhom the centurytempests call son,Having striven to rend him in vain.
I walked to observe, not to feel,Not to fancy, if simple of eyeOne may be among images reapedFor a shift of the glance, as grainProfitless froth you espyAshore after billows have leaped.
I fled nothing, nothing pursuedThe changeful visible faceOf our Mother I sought for my foodCrumbs by the way to sustain.
Her sentence I knew past grace.
Myself I had lost of us twain,Once bound in mirroring thought.
She had flung me to dust in her wakeAnd I, as your convict dragsHis chain, by the scourge untaught,Bore life for a goad, without aim.
I champed the sensations that makeOf a ruffled philosophy rags.
For them was no meaning too blunt,Nor aspect too cutting of steel.
This Earth of the beautiful breasts,Shining up in all colours aflame,To them had visage of hagsA Mother of aches and jestsSoulless, heading a huntAimless except for the meal.
Hope, with the star on her frontFear, with an eye in the heelOur links to a Mother of graceThey were dead on the nerve, and deadFor the nature divided in threeGone out of heart, out of brain,Out of soul I had in their placeThe calm of an empty room.
We were joined but by that thin thread,My disciplined habit to see.
And those conjure images, those,The puppets of loss or gainNot he who is bare to his doomFor whom never semblance playsTo bewitch, overcloud, illume.
The dusty moteimages roseSheer film of the surface awagThey sank as they rose their painDeclaring them mine of old days.
Now gazed I where, sole upon gloom,As flowerbush in sunspecked crag,Up the spine of the double combeWith yewboughs heavily cloaked,A young apparition shoneKnown, yet wonderful, whiteSurpassingly doubtfully known,For it struck as the birth of LightEven Day from the dark unyoked.
It waved like a pilgrim flagOer processional penitents flownWhen of old they broke rounding yon spineO the pure wildcherry in bloom!For their Eastward march to the shrineOf the footsore fareyed Faith,Was banner so brave, so fair,So quick with celestial signOf victorious rays over deathFor a conquest of coward despair Division of soul from wits,And these made rulersfull sure,More starlike never did shineTo illumine the sinister fieldWhere our lifes old nightbird flits.
I knew it with her, my own,Had hailed it pure of the pureOur beacon yearly but strangeWhen it strikes to within is the knownRicher than newness revealed.
There was needed darkness like mine.
Its beauty to vividness blownDrew the life in me forward, chased,From aloft on a pinnacles range,That hindward spidery line,The length of the ways I had paced,A footfarer out of the dawn,To Youths wild forest, where sprang,For the morning of May long gone,The forests white virgin sheSeen yonder and sheltered me, sangShe in me, I in her what songsThe fawneared woodhollows reviveTo pour forth their tunefooted throngsInspire to the dreaming of goodIllimitable to comeShe, the white wild cherry, a tree,Earthrooted, tangibly wood,Yet a presence throbbing aliveNor she in our language dumbA spirit born of a treeBecause earthrooted aliveHuntress of things worth pursuitOf souls in our naming, dreams.
And each unto other was lute,By fits quick as breezy gleams.
My quiver of aims and desiresHad colour that she would have ownedAnd if by humaner firesHued later, these held her enthronedMy crescent of Earth my bloodAt the silvery early stirHour of the thrill of the budAbout to burst, and by herDirected, attuned, englobedMy Goddess, the chaste, not chillChoir over choir whiterobedWhitebosomed fold within foldFor so could I dream, breastbare,In my time of blooming dream stillThrough the maze, the mesh, and the wreck,Despite, since manhood was bold,The yoke of the flesh on my neck.
She beckoned, I gazed, unawareHow a shaft of the blossoming treeWas shot from the yewwoods core.
I stood to the touch of a keyTurned in a fastshut door.
They rounded my garden, content,The small fry, clutching their fee,Their fruit of the wreath and the poleAnd, chatter, hop, skip, they were sent,In a buzz of young company glee,Their natural music, swift shoalTo the next easy shedders of pence.
Why not for they had me in tuneWith the hungers of my kind.
Do readings of earth draw thence,Then a concord deeper than criesOf the Whither whose echo is Whence,To jar unanswered, shall riseAs a fountainjet in the mindBowed dark oer the falling and strewn.
  Unwitting where it might lead,How it came, for the anguish to cease,And the Questions that sow not nor spin,This wisdom, roughwritten, and black,As of veins that from venom bleed,I had with the peace withinOr patience, mortal of peace,Compressing the surgent strifeIn a heart laid open, not mailed,To the last blank hour of the rack,When struck the dividing knifeWhen the hand that never had failedIn its pressure to mine hung slack.
But this in myself did I know,Not needing a studious brow,Or trust in a governing star,While my ears held the jangled shoutThe children were lifting afarThat natures at interflowWith all of their past and the now,Are chords to the Nature without,Orbs to the greater wholeFirst then, nor utterly thenTill our lord of sensations at war,The rebel, the heart, yields placeTo brain, each prompting the soul.
Thus our dear Earth we embraceFor the milk, her strength to men.
And crave we her medical herb,We have but to see and hear,Though pierced by the cruel acerb,The troops of the memories armedHostile to strike at the nestThat nourished and flew them warmed.
Not she gives the tear for the tear.
Weep, bleed, rave, writhe, be distraught,She is moveless.
 Not of her breastAre the symbols we conjure when FearTakes leaven of Hope.
 I caught,With Death in me shrinking from Death,As cold from cold, for a signOf the life beyond ashes I cast,Believing the vision divine,Wings of that dream of my YouthTo the spirit beloved twas unglassedOn her breast, in her depths austereA flash through the mist, mere breath,Breath on a buckler of steel.
For the flesh in revolt at her laws,Neither song nor smile in ruth,Nor promise of things to reveal,Has she, nor a word she saithWe are asking her wheels to pause.
Well knows she the cry of unfaith.
If we strain to the farther shore,We are catching at comfort near.
Assurances, symbols, saws,Revelations in legends, lightTo eyes rolling darkness, theseDesired of the flesh in affright,For the which it will swear to adore,She yields not for prayers at her kneesThe woolly beast bleating will shear.
These are our sensual dreamsOf the yearning to touch, to feelThe dark Impalpable sure,And have the Unveiled appearWhereon ever black she beams,Doth of her terrible deal,She who dotes over ripeness at play,Rosiness fondles and feeds,Guides it with shepherding crook,To her sports and her pastures alway.
Not she gives the tear for the tearHarsh wisdom gives Earth, no moreIn one the spur and the curbAn answer to thoughts or deedsTo the Legends an alien lookTo the Questions a figure of clay.
Yet we have but to see and hear,Crave we her medical herb.
For the road to her soul is the RealThe root of the growth of manAnd the senses must traverse it freshWith a love that no scourge shall abate,To reach the lone heights where we scanIn the minds rarer vision this fleshIn the charge of the Mother our fateHer law as the one common weal.
We, whom the view benumbs,We, quivering upward, each hourKnow battle in air and in groundFor the breath that goes as it comes,For the choice between sweet and sour,For the smallest grain of our worthAnd he who the reckoning sumsFinds nought in his hand save Earth.
Of Earth are we stripped or crowned.
The fleeting Present we crave,Barter our best to wed,In hope of a cushioned bower,What is it but Future and PastLike wind and tide at a wave!Idea of the senses, bredFor the senses to snap and devourThin as the shell of a soundIn delivery, withered in light.
Cry we for permanence fast,Permanence hangs by the graveSits on the grave greengrassed,On the roll of the heaved gravemound.
By Death, as by Life, are we fedThe two are one spring our bondWith the numbers with whom to uniteHere feathers wings for beyondOnly they can waft us in flight.
For they are Realitys flower.
Of them, and the contact with them,Issues Earths dearest daughter, the firmIn footing, the stately of stemUnshaken though elements lourA warrior heart unquelledMirror of Earth, and guideTo the Holies from sense withheldReason, mans germinant fruit.
She wrestles with our old wormSelf in the narrow and wideRelentless quencher of lies,With laughter she pierces the bruteAnd hear we her laughter peal,Tis Light in us dancing to scourThe loathed recess of his densScatter his monstrous bed,And hound him to harrow and plough.
She is the worlds one prizeOur champion, rightfully headThe vessel whose piloted prow,Though Folly froth round, hiss and hoot,Leaves legible print at the keel.
Nor least is the service she does,That service to her may cleanseThe well of the Sorrows in usFor a common delight will drainThe rank individual fensOf a wound refusing to healWhile the old worm slavers its root.
I bowed as a leaf in rainAs a tree when the leaf is shedTo winds in the season at waneAnd when from my soul I said,May the worm be trampled smite,Sacred Reality! powerFilled me to front it aright.
I had come of my faiths ordeal.
It is not to stand on a towerAnd see the flat universe reelOur mortal sublimities dropLike raiment by glisterlings worn,At a sweep of the scythe for the crop.
Wisdom is won of its fight,The combat incessant and driesTo mummywrap perching a height.
It chews the contemplative cudIn peril of isolate scorn,Unfed of the onward flood.
Nor view we a different mornIf we gaze with the deeper sight,With the deeper thought forewiseThe world is the same, seen throughThe features of men are the same.
But let their historian newIn the language of nakedness write,Rejoice we to know not shame,Not a dread, not a doubt to have doneWith the tortures of thought in the throes,Our animal tangle, and graspVery sap of the vital in thisThat from flesh unto spirit man growsEven here on the sod under sunThat she of the wantons kiss,Broken through with the bite of an asp,Is Mother of simple truth,Relentless quencher of liesEternal in thought discernedIn thought midferry betweenThe Life and the Death, which are one,As our breath in and out, joy or teen.
She gives the rich vision to youth,If we will, of her prompting wiseOr men by the lash made lean,Who in harness the mind subserve,Their title to read her have earnedHaving mastered sensationinsaneAt a stroke of the terrified nerveAnd out of the sensual hiveGrown to the flower of brainTo know her a thing alive,Whose aspects mutably swerve,Whose laws immutably reign.
Our sentencer, clother in mist,Her morn bends breast to her noon,Noon to the hour darkdyed,If we will, of her promptings wiseHer light is our own if we list.
The legends that sweep her aside,Crying loud for an opiate boon,To comfort the human want,From the bosom of magical skies,She smiles on, marking their sourceThey read her with infant eyes.
Good ships of morality they,For our crude developing forceGranite the thought to stay,That she is a thing aliveTo the living, the falling and strewn.
But the Questions, the broods that hauntSensation insurgent, may drive,The way of the channelling mole,Head in a groundvault gauntAs your telescopes skeleton moon.
Barren comfort to these will she doleDead is her face to their cries.
Intelligence pushing to tasteA lesson from beasts might heed.
They scatter a voice in the waste,Where any dry swish of a reedBy greyglassy water replies.
They see not above or belowFarthest are they from my soul,Earth whispers they scarce have the thirst,Except to unriddle a runeAnd I spin none only show,Would humanity soar from its worst,Winged above darkness and dole,How flesh unto spirit must grow.
Spirit raves not for a goal.
Shapes in mans likeness hewnDesires not neither desiresThe sleep or the glory it trustsUses my gifts, yet aspiresDreams of a higher than it.
The dream is an atmosphereA scale still ascending to knitThe clear to the loftier Clear.
Tis Reason herself, tiptoeAt the ultimate bound of her wit,On the verges of Night and Day.
But is it a dream of the lusts,To my dustiest tis decreedAnd them that so shuffle astrayI touch with no key of goldFor the wealth of the secret nookThough I dote over ripeness at play,Rosiness fondle and feed,Guide it with shepherding crookTo my sports and my pastures alway.
The key will shriek in the lock,The door will rustily hinge,Will open on features of mould,To vanish corrupt at a glimpse,And mock as the wild echoes mock,Soulless in mimic, doth GreedOr the passion for fruitage tingeThat dream, for your parricide impsTo wing through the body of Time,Yourselves in slaying him slay.
Much are you shots of your prime,You men of the act and the dreamAnd please you to fatten a weedThat perishes, pledged to decay,Tis dearth in your season of need,Down the slopes of the shoreward way Nigh on the misty stream,Where Ferryman under his hood,With a call to be ready to payThe small coin, whitens red blood.
But the young ethereal seedShall bring you the bread no buyerCan have for his craving supremeTo my quenchless quick shall speedThe soul at her wrestle rudeWith devil, with angel more direWith the flesh, with the Fates, enringed.
The dream of the blossom of GoodIs your banner of battle unrolledIn its waver and current and curveChoir over choir whitewinged,Whitebosomed fold within foldHopeful of victory mostWhen hard is the task to sustainAssaults of the fearful senseAt a mind in desolate moodWith the Whither, whose echo is WhenceAnd humanitys clamour, lost, lostAnd its clasp of the staves that snapAnd evil abroad, as a mainUproarious, bursting its dyke.
For back do you look, and lo,Forward the harvest of grain! Numbers in council, awakeTo love more than things of my lap,Love me and to let the types break,Men be grass, rocks rivers, all flowAll save the dream sink alikeTo the source of my vital in sapTheir battle, their loss, their ache,For my pledge of vitality know.
The dream is the thought in the ghostThe thought sent flying for foodEyeless, but sprung of an aimSupernal of Reason, to findThe great OverReason we nameBeneficence mind seeking Mind.
Dream of the blossom of Good,In its waver and current and curve,With the hopes of my offspring enscrolled!Soon to be seen of a hostThe flag of the Master I serve!And life in them doubled on Life,As flame upon flame, to behold,High over Timetumbled sea,The bliss of his headship of strife,Him through handmaiden me.
CHANGE IN RECURRENCEII stood at the gate of the cotWhere my darling, with sideglance demure,Would spy, on her trim gardenplot,The busy wild things chase and lure.
For these with their ways were her feastThey had surety no enemy lurked.
Their deftest of tricks to their leastShe gathered in watch as she worked.
IIWhen berries were red on her ash,The blackbird would rifle them rough,Till the ground underneath looked a gash,And her rogue grew the round of a chough.
The squirrel cocked ear oer his hoop,Up the spruce, quick as eye, trailing brush.
She knew any tit of the troopAll as well as the snailtapping thrush.
IIII gazed twas the scene of the frame,With the face, the dear life for me, fled.
No window a lute to my name,No watcher there plying the thread.
But the blackbird hung peeking at willThe squirrel from cone hopped to coneThe thrush had a snail in his bill,And taptapped the shell hard on a stone.
HYMN TO COLOURIWith Life and Death I walked when Love appeared,And made them on each side a shadow seem.
Through wooded vales the land of dawn we neared,Where down smooth rapids whirls the helmless dreamTo fall on daylight and night puts awayHer darker veil for grey.
IIIn that grey veil green grassblades brushed we byWe came where woods breathed sharp, and overheadRocks raised clear horns on a transforming skyAround, save for those shapes, with him who ledAnd linked them, desert varied by no signOf other life than mine.
IIIBy this the darkwinged planet, raying wide,From the mild pearlglow to the rose upborne,Drew in his fires, less faint than far descried,Purefronted on a stronger wave of mornAnd those two shapes the splendour interweaved,Hung weblike, sank and heaved.
IVLove took my hand when hidden stood the sunTo fling his robe on shoulderheights of snow.
Then said There lie they, Life and Death in one.
Whichever is, the other is but know,It is thy craving self that thou dost see,Not in them seeing me.
VShall man into the mystery of breath,From his quick beating pulse a pathway spyOr learn the secret of the shrouded death,By lifting up the lid of a white eyeCleave thou thy way with fathering desireOf fire to reach to fire.
VILook now where Colour, the souls bridegroom, makesThe house of heaven splendid for the bride.
To him as leaps a fountain she awakes,In knotting arms, yet boundless him beside,She holds the flower to heaven, and by his powerBrings heaven to the flower.
VIIHe gives her homeliness in desert air,And sovereignty in spaciousness he leadsThrough widening chambers of surprise to whereThrobs rapture near an end that aye recedes,Because his touch is infinite and lendsA yonder to all ends.
VIIIDeath begs of Life his blush Life Death persuadesTo keep long day with his caresses graced.
He is the heart of light, the wing of shades,The crown of beauty never soul embracedOf him can harbour unfaith soul of himPossessed walks never dim.
IXLove eyed his rosy memories he sangO bloom of dawn, breathed up from the gold sheafHeld springing beneath Orient! that dost hangThe space of dewdrops running over leafThy fleetingness is bigger in the ghostThan Time with all his host!XOf thee to say behold, has said adieuBut love remembers how the sky was green,And how the grasses glimmered lightest blueHow saintlike grey took fervour how the screenOf cloud grew violet how thy moment cameBetween a blush and flame.
XILove saw the emissary eglantineBreak wave round thy white feet above the gloomLay finger on thy star thy raiment lineWith cherub wing and limb wed thy soft bloom,Goldquivering like sunrays in thistledown,Earth under rolling brown.
XIIThey do not look through love to look on thee,Grave heavenliness! nor know they joy of sight,Who deem the wave of rapt desire must beIts wrecking and last issue of delight.
Dead seasons quicken in one petalspotOf colour unforgot.
XIIIThis way have men come out of brutishnessTo spell the letters of the sky and readA reflex upon earth else meaningless.
With thee, O fount of the Untimed! to lead,Drink they of thee, thee eyeing, they unagedShall on through brave wars waged.
XIVMore gardens will they win than any lostThe vile plucked out of them, the unlovely slain.
Not forfeiting the beast with which they are crossed,To stature of the Gods will they attain.
They shall uplift their Earth to meet her Lord,Themselves the attuning chord!XVThe song had ceased my vision with the song.
Then of those Shadows, which one made descentBeside me I knew not but Life ere longCame on me in the public ways and bentEyes deeper than of old Death met I too,And saw the dawn glow through.
MEDITATION UNDER STARSWhat links are ours with orbs that areSo resolutely farThe solitary asks, and theyGive radiance as from a shieldStill at the death of day,The seen, the unrevealed.
Implacable they shineTo us who would of Life obtainAn answer for the life we strainTo nourish with one sign.
Nor can imagination throwThe penetrative shaft we passThe breath of thought, who would divineIf haply they may growAs Earth have our desire to knowIf life comes there to grain from grass,And flowers like ours of toil and painHas passion to beat bar,Win space from cleaving brainThe mystic link attain,Whereby star holds on star.
Those visible immortals beamAllurement to the dreamIreful at human hungers brookNo question in the look.
For ever virgin to our sense,Remote they wane to gaze intenseProlong it, and in ruthlessness they smiteThe beating heart behind the ball of sightTill we conceive their heavens hoar,Those lights they raise but sparkles frore,And Earth, our bloodwarm Earth, a shuddering preyTo that frigidity of brainless ray.
Yet space is given for breath of thoughtBeyond our bounds when musing moreWhen to that musing love is brought,And love is asked of loves wherefore.
Tis Earths, her gift else have we noughtHer gift, her secret, here our tie.
And not with her and yonder skyBethink you were it Earth aloneBreeds love, would not her region beThe sole delight and throneOf generous DeityTo deeper than this ball of sightAppeal the lustrous people of the night.
Fronting yon shoreless, sown with fiery sails,It is our ravenous that quails,Flesh by its craven thirsts and fears distraught.
The spirit leaps alight,Doubts not in them is he,The binder of his sheaves, the sane, the rightOf magnitude to magnitude is wrought,To feel it large of the great life they holdIn them to come, or vaster intervolved,The issues known in us, our unsolved solvedThat there with toil Life climbs the selfsame Tree,Whose roots enrichment have from ripeness dropped.
So may we read and little find them coldLet it but be the lord of Mind to guideOur eyes no branch of Reasons growing loppedNor dreaming on a dream but fortifiedBy day to penetrate black midnight see,Hear, feel, outside the senses even that we,The specks of dust upon a mound of mould,We who reflect those rays, though low our place,To them are lastingly allied.
So may we read, and little find them coldNot frosty lamps illumining dead space,Not distant aliens, not senseless Powers.
The fire is in them whereof we are bornThe music of their motion may be ours.
Spirit shall deem them beckoning Earth and voicedSisterly to her, in her beams rejoiced.
Of love, the grand impulsion, we beholdThe love that lends her graceAmong the starry fold.
Then at new flood of customary morn,Look at her through her showers,Her mists, her streaming gold,A wonder edges the familiar faceShe wears no more that robe of printed hoursHalf strange seems Earth, and sweeter than her flowers.
WOODMAN AND ECHOClose Echo hears the woodmans axe,To double on it, as in glee,With clap of hands, and little lacksOf meaning in her repartee.
For all shall fall,As one has done,The tree of me,Of thee the treeAnd unto allThe fate we waitReveals the wheelsWhereon we runWe tower to flower,We spread the shade,We drop for crop,At length are laidAre rolled in mould,From chop and lopAnd are we thick in woodland tracks,Or tempting of our stature we,The end is one, we do but waxFor service over land and sea.
So, strike! the likeShall thus of us,My brawny woodman, claim the tax.
Nor foe thy blow,Though wood be good,And shriekingly the timber cracksThe ground we crownedShall speed the seedOf younger into swelling sacks.
For use he hews,To make awakeThe spirit of what stuff we beOur earth of mirthAnd tears he clearsFor braver, let our minds agreeAnd then will menWithin them winAn Echo clapping harmony.
THE WISDOM OF ELDWe spend our lives in learning pilotage,And grow good steersmen when the vessels crank!Gaptoothed he spake, and with a tottering shankSidled to gain the sunny bench of Age.
It is the sentence which completes that stageA testament of wisdom reading blank.
The seniors of the race, on their last plank,Pass mumbling it as natures final page.
These, bent by such experience, are the bandWho captain young enthusiasts to maintainWhat things we view, and Earths decree withstand,Lest dreaded Change, long dammed by dull decay,Should bring the world a vessel steered by brain,And ancients musical at close of day.
EARTHS PREFERENCEEarth loves her young a preference manifestShe prompts them to her fruits and flowerbedsTheir beauty with her choicest interthreads,And makes her revel of their merry zestAs in our East much were it in our West,If men had risen to do the work of heads.
Her gabbling grey she eyes askant, nor treadsThe ways they walk by what they speak oppressed.
How wrought they in their zenith Tis not writNot all yet she by one sure sign can readHave they but held her laws and nature dear,They mouth no sentence of inverted wit.
More prizes she her beasts than this high breedWry in the shape she wastes her milk to rear.
SOCIETYHistoric be the survey of our kind,And how their brave Society took shape.
Lion, wolf, vulture, fox, jackal and ape,The strong of limb, the keen of nose, we find,Who, with some jars in harmony, combined,Their primal instincts taming, to escapeThe brawl indecent, and hot passions drape.
Convenience pricked conscience, that the mind.
Thus entered they the field of milder beasts,Which in some sort of civil order graze,And do halfhomage to the God of Laws.
But are they still for their old ravenous feasts,Earth gives the edifice they build no baseThey spring another flood of fangs and claws.
WINTER HEAVENSSharp is the night, but stars with frost aliveLeap off the rim of earth across the dome.
It is a night to make the heavens our homeMore than the nest whereto apace we strive.
Lengths down our road each firtree seems a hive,In swarms outrushing from the golden comb.
They waken waves of thoughts that burst to foamThe living throb in me, the dead revive.
Yon mantle clothes us there, past mortal breath,Life glistens on the river of the death.
It folds us, flesh and dust and have we knelt,Or never knelt, or eyed as kine the springsOf radiance, the radiance enringsAnd this is the souls haven to have felt.
